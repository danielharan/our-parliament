            "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise on a question of privilege with regard to Bill C-23, an act to modernize the statutes of Canada in relation to benefits and obligations.\n\nThe government let it be known that it would table Bill C-23 on Friday, February 11, 2000. The bill was tabled at noon on that day which is the prescribed time for tabling bills on a Friday pursuant to Standing Order 30.\n\nIn an e-mail that was sent from John Fisher, Egale@sympatico.ca, the author outlined in detail his analysis of Bill C-23. It was sent at 10.56 a.m. on Friday, one hour and four minutes before Bill C-23 was tabled in the House of Commons.\n\nIn order to do an analysis of a omnibus bill such as Bill C-23, the author would have had to be in possession of the bill many hours before his e-mail transmission.\n\nWith references from the authorities on parliamentary procedure and rulings from two distinguished Speakers, I will attempt to defend the integrity, the dignity and authority of the House. I will try to defend against what I view as a mockery of the parliamentary system.\n\nMy question of privilege holds the Minister of Justice responsible for leaking information and the author of the aforementioned e-mail for obtaining and using information contrary to parliamentary law and practices.\n\nThis problem is not new. On April 20, 1999 the matter of the government leaking a government response to a report of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs was raised in the House. The next day the government House leader apologized for the leak and assured the House it would not happen again.\n\nThe very next day after the apology, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development stood up in the House and quoted from an in-camera meeting.\n\nWhen the parliamentary process is circumvented in this manner, the role of the House is misrepresented.\n\nOn October 10, 1989 the integrity of the House was also under siege and ironically the member who came to the defence of parliament was the hon. member for Windsor West, the now Deputy Prime Minister. The Deputy Prime Minister was quoted in a Speaker's ruling as saying that it was clearly contempt of parliament to misrepresent the role of the House.\n\nWhile the Speaker in 1989 did not rule a prima facie question of privilege, he did say:\n\nI want the House to understand very clearly that if your Speaker ever has to consider a situation like this again, the Chair will not be as generous.\n\nOn November 6, 1997 the Speaker said of a similar matter:\n\n—the chair acknowledges that it is a matter of potential importance since it touches the role of members has legislators, a role which should not be trivialized. The dismissive view of the legislative process, repeated often enough, makes a mockery of our parliamentary conventions and practices. I trust that today's decision at this early stage of the 36th Parliament will not be forgotten by the minister and his officials and that the department and agencies will guided by it.\n\nOn page 95 of Marleau and Montpetit it states:\n\nMuch like a court of law, the House of Commons enjoys very wide latitude in maintaining its dignity and authority through the exercise of contempt power, which is inherent to any superior court. In other words, the House may, through its orders consider any misconduct to be contempt and may deal with it accordingly. This area of parliamentary law is therefore extremely fluid and most valuable for the Commons to be able to meet novel situations.\n\nThis House can no longer allow its dignity and authority to be mocked in this way. The consequence of inaction only encourages it to continue.\n\nVery recently the Prime Minister announced the date of the budget outside the House. As far as I know, this has never been done before. Not only did it put egg on the face of the Minister of Finance, but the Prime Minister showed arrogance and disrespect for the House of Commons.\n\nIt was not that long ago when the Minister of International Trade who on March 30, 1998 sent out a press release entitled “Marchi Meets with Chinese Leaders in Beijing and Announces Canada-China Interparliamentary Group”. At that time there was no Canada-China interparliamentary group. The minister gave the impression to some one billion people in China that the association existed when parliament had not approved it.\n\nWe had the naming of the head of the Canadian Millennium Scholarship Foundation by this government before there was legislation setting up the foundation.\n\nWe had the matter raised by the member for Prince George—Peace River regarding the Canadian Wheat Board on February 3, 1998.\n\nAnother case involving the Department of Finance was argued on October 28, 1997.\n\nThere is a litany of cases of leaked committee reports that go unchecked and unchallenged. It is time that we take this matter seriously.\n\nMadam Speaker, if you rule this to be a prima facie question of privilege, I am prepared to move the appropriate motion today.",

In other words, I believe the Speaker expressed a good deal of concern that information, which should be coming first to the House, is being given, for whatever reasons, to other groups and organizations and leaked to the media.\n\nIt is important to note that in his past ruling the Speaker said that enough is enough and that it is time for the government to treat this institution with the respect it deserves.\n\nThere is another thing which is important to note in this case as we enter into the debate on Bill C-23. The objection is not with the bill itself which we will oppose for other reasons that will be brought forward shortly in debate, but it is for the disrespect the government chooses to exhibit toward this place. It should be treating this place with the dignity it deserves and members of parliament with the dignity they deserve.\n\nThe member opposite seems to think it is just fine to take a bill that should be tabled in the House, give it to other people ahead of time and get them to issue press releases. They get advance copies even before members of the House.\n\nMadam Speaker, that is the problem. That is why I ask that you rule that this is a prima facie question of privilege. The member could move the appropriate motion and we could discuss this further because again it shows disrespect for the House.",

Members are quite appropriately sensitive to the parliamentary traditions and the rules that we follow in particular with respect to impending legislation.\n\nIn this case there is an allegation that someone outside the House had knowledge of impending legislation. Of course that is not a surprise or a secret to anyone because this legislation had been speculated on frequently over the last few weeks. In fact, the government did quite a bit of consultation with citizens on the bill. Notice of the bill being introduced in parliament was tabled in the House.\n\nIt is worth noting that nowhere is there a suggestion here that the individual referred to had a copy of the bill. It is clear that the individual would have had some knowledge of some elements of the bill as did members of parliament around the House.\n\nQuite frequently the press is able to put together enough information about impending legislation to write about it before the bill is actually introduced. That is one of the things that happened in this case.\n\nI would just note that the government does consult with citizens and groups. Ministers do it, ministries do it and members of parliament do it. Consequently members of the public do have knowledge of elements of impending legislation. I suggest that is what has happened here.\n\nI would also point out that it is not the government, the minister or the ministry which has prepared the briefing or publicly sent a letter attempting to analyse the bill. It was a citizen. I hope there is no fault alleged in relation to the minister here.\n\nIn any event I make those comments for the record and hope that they will assist the Chair.",

Of this total, salaries account for $5,817,351 and operating costs totalled $9,372,180.\n\nIn response to the specific areas raised in the question:\n\n(a) Salaries account for $5,817,351 of total administrative costs.\n\n(b) Consultant fees total $1,541,844, with the majority of costs incurred to develop the infrastructure for informatics necessary to support the program.\n\n(c) Advertising was undertaken to ensure that all eligible producers were aware of the program and sent in an application. Total advertising costs were $1,516,255.\n\n(d) The cost of furniture was $16,489. Rentals totalled $250,277.\n\n(e) Travel costs totalled $257,405.

It ensures respect for the principle of equal treatment before the law of persons living in recognized stable relationships.\n\nBill C-23 ensures that federal laws reflect the core values of Canadians, values that are enshrined in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.\n\nThe fundamental tenets of Canadian society—fairness, tolerance, respect and equality—are touchstones of our national identity and serve to enhance our international reputation.\n\nBill C-23 brings federal statutes into line with these values. It ensures that the principle of equal treatment under the law, in relation to individuals in committed common law relationships, is respected.\n\nEqually important, Bill C-23 does so while preserving the existing legal definition and societal consensus that marriage is the union of one man and one woman to the exclusion of all others. Let me briefly elaborate on this point.\n\nThis definition of marriage, which has been consistently applied in Canada and which was reaffirmed last year through a resolution of the House, dates back to 1866. It has served us well and will not change. We recognize that marriage is a fundamental value and important to Canadians. That value and importance is in no way undermined by recognizing in law other forms of committed relationships.\n\nThe timing of this bill is important. As Canadians have pointed out, society is ready for this change. In fact there have been numerous challenges before the courts and human rights tribunals concerning the equal treatment of same sex couples. The results of these processes have invariably been the same. Common law same sex couples must be accorded the same access as common law opposite sex couples to the social benefits programs to which they have contributed.\n\nTo ignore either obligations or benefits is discriminatory and in violation of both the charter of rights and freedoms and the Canadian Human Rights Act. Indeed, this was the ruling of the Supreme Court of Canada in the case of M. v H. But while the courts have provided us with a road map of what needs to be changed, the onus is on us as parliamentarians to determine how to proceed.\n\nImportant matters of social policy should not be left to the courts to decide. If parliament does not address the issue, the courts will continue to hand down decisions in a piecemeal fashion, interpreting narrow points of law on the specific questions before them. This guarantees confusion and continuing costly litigation. Most worrisome, it risks removing us from the social policy process altogether.\n\nIn recent surveys more than two out of three Canadians agreed that same sex couples should have the same legal rights and obligations as their common law opposite sex counterparts. The changes we are proposing are consistent with our previous efforts to adapt policies to changing values. They are also consistent with the efforts of other jurisdictions and the private sector. For example, last year parliament passed Bill C-78, which extended survivor pension benefits to same sex partners of federal public service employees. Manitoba, Quebec, Saskatchewan, British Columbia, Ontario, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Yukon, Nunavut and the Northwest Territories have undertaken similar initiatives for their public service employees. As well, several provinces have already begun to amend their legislation more broadly.\n\nSince 1997 British Columbia has amended numerous statutes, including six core statutes, to add same sex couples.\n\nLast year Quebec amended 28 statutes and 11 regulations to grant same sex couples the same benefits and obligations that are available to opposite sex common law couples.\n\nLast fall, to comply with the supreme court decision in M. v H., the Government of Ontario passed omnibus legislation to bring 67 statutes into compliance with that court ruling.\n\nMost large cities in Canada and more than 200 major private sector Canadian companies currently provide benefits to the same sex partners of their employees, as do many smaller municipalities, hospitals, libraries and social service institutions across Canada. We are on the right side of public opinion and we are on the right side of the law.\n\nIt is against this backdrop that I would like to clarify what this legislation will do. This omnibus bill provides a responsible, balanced and legally sound framework within which to amend relevant Canadian laws.\n\nThe bill will enable us to modernize existing federal laws affecting some 20 departments and agencies. In all, 68 statutes will be affected, including, among others, the Income Tax Act, the Canada pension plan and the Old Age Security Act.\n\nBecause of the comprehensive nature of this legislation we will now be able to ensure that our laws confer both benefits and obligations equally to all common law relationships, whether of the opposite sex or the same sex. This is a critical point, the significance of which must not be lost. This law is about equality, and equality is a two-way street. We are not simply extending access to certain social benefits to same sex couples, we are also imposing new obligations on them.\n\nAs I stated earlier, Bill C-23 maintains the clear distinction between married and unmarried relationships. Wherever possible neutral terms are used to define relationships and the partners within them. For example, the term survivor is used in the Canada pension plan context.\n\nWhere a neutral term could not be used the act uses the term common law partner—conjoint de fait en français to encompass people in common law relationships, both opposite and same sex. The term spouse—époux en français—will now be used exclusively in relation to married couples.\n\nBill C-23 will bring fairness to the application of government benefits and obligations to all common law couples. Let me cite just a few examples.\n\nIf we look at the issue of benefits first we can see that the new laws will treat Canadian couples more fairly. Under the Canada pension plan, for example, the surviving spouse in a married relationship or the surviving partner in a common law opposite sex relationship may qualify for survivor's benefits based on his or her spouse's or partner's contributions to the plan. Bill C-23 would provide that in similar circumstances the surviving partner in a common law same sex relationship would qualify for the same benefits.\n\nAt the same time however, the changes are, as I mentioned earlier, not one way. Common law same sex couples will also be subject to the same obligations as common law opposite sex couples.\n\nIn the case of bankruptcy, for example, the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act limits the ability of married people to transfer ownership of their home or property to their spouse prior to declaring bankruptcy. Yet, because this statute refers to spouse, it does not apply equally to common law opposite sex or same sex couples. In this instance the changes would provide for similar obligations for married and common law couples.\n\nThere are also obligations associated with eligibility for the GST-HST credit. In married and common law opposite sex relationships the combined income of the two partners is used to determine eligibility for the tax credit. By comparison, people in same sex partnerships may currently apply for the credit as individuals. With Bill C-23, in order to determine eligibility to receive this tax credit, same sex couples will now declare the income of their common law partners.\n\nThe Department of Finance has concluded that the cost of these measures will be minimal, if any. Clearly this is not a cost issue.\n\nCanadians do not want laws that discriminate unfairly or that violate charter principles. We must proceed expeditiously with this bill because it is clearly the right thing to do. We should be proud to support this bill.\n\nBefore I conclude, I would like to address the issue of other dependent relationships in which some members of the House have expressed an interest. I would first like to emphasize that by moving forward with this legislation we are not precluding discussion which has already started on whether or how to acknowledge the nature and reality of the many types of dependent relationships that exist. We know there is some interest in extending benefits and obligations to individuals in other relationships of economic and emotional interdependence.\n\nDependency is a complex issue with far-reaching consequences for both individuals and society as a whole. It deserves to be studied carefully. It is for this reason that we will be referring this issue to a parliamentary committee.\n\nIndeed, there is a qualitative difference between the relationships addressed in Bill C-23 and the types of relationships that may exist among relatives, siblings or friends living under the same roof and sharing household expenses. The reality is that many adult Canadians currently reside with elderly parents, siblings and other relatives. While benefits that reflect dependency would likely be welcome, it is not quite so clear whether the accompanying legal obligations would be equally well received.\n\nFor example, one could take the case of an elderly woman living with her son and daughter-in-law. Should the younger couple's combined income be included in the senior citizen's calculations of her eligibility for the guaranteed income supplement under the Old Age Security Act? Or, consider the example children caring for parents in their home. In one case a daughter supports her widowed father. In the house next door, another woman provides for both her mother and father. How would we treat these cases? Would relationships of dependency apply to any two people who live together or to unlimited numbers as long as they are under the same roof?\n\nOther issues also need to be resolved. These include how dependency relationships would be defined and which relationships would be allowed. Would individuals be allowed to self-identify their relationships or would the government require proof of some kind? Would the government exclude any relatives from these relationships of dependency, as France has done, or exclude only opposite sex common law couples, as Hawaii has chosen to do?\n\nThese are not trivial issues and they are not amenable to easy answers. It is for this very reason that we must consult broadly with Canadians. These issues are too important to act on before talking to Canadians about what it means to take the benefits and also what it means to accept the obligations.\n\nOthers have endorsed the notion of domestic registries for unmarried adults living in dependent relationships. Under this system two adults living together whether they are unmarried sisters, elderly parents living with an adult child, or lifelong friends who are roommates could register for benefits and obligations. Proceeding down this path requires discussion with those likely to be affected and an assessment of costs and discussion with the provinces and territories.\n\nMoreover it is not clear that voluntary registries are the best solution. What happens for example where a clear dependency exists but one partner refuses to register in order to avoid obligations? Should the relationship be deemed to exist and if couples can register, under what circumstances can they deregister and what if only one of the partners wishes to do so?\n\nThere are also important privacy issues to consider. Presumably a registry would be open to the public in the same way registries are for births and deaths. This might result in people being forced to have their relationship publicly known. More important, if such a system were created at the federal level, it would have limited utility as it would apply only to areas of federal jurisdiction.\n\nIn Canada where the many pieces of legislation that grant benefits and impose obligations are divided between or shared among the federal, provincial and territorial governments, a registry would require the unanimous agreement of all levels of government. This would be necessary to help assure Canadians that a registry would work effectively, efficiently and fairly.\n\nProceeding with such a policy on a unilateral basis without public hearings, without assessing the costs and without consulting with the provinces and territories would be irresponsible and unrealistic.\n\nAll parliamentarians agree that in considering changes to the system we must encourage rather than discourage people to take care of each other. We must be careful to ensure that any legal changes would not impose obligations that act as barriers to people supporting each other.\n\nThis legislation is about ensuring that Canadians in committed common law relationships are treated equally and fairly. This bill is about tolerance and respect. I invite all members of the House to support the bill.",

This bill will affect 68 different federal statutes and 20 different departments and agencies to extend benefits to same sex couples on the same basis as opposite sex common law or married couples.\n\nThe bill states in the preamble that it is intended to reflect values of tolerance, respect, equality with respect to the benefits and obligations of all couples. The bill is the government's poorly thought out quick fix approach to an issue which requires a much more thoughtful and comprehensive approach in order to realize the values it says it is intending to reflect.\n\nI will primarily be examining two aspects of the bill that make it so weak in its current form that no thinking person could possibly support the bill. I will also suggest some ways to improve the bill.\n\nLet me begin by reminding the House of a particular motion that was debated and passed in the House by a four to one margin just a few short months ago in June 1999.

            "text": "Madam Speaker, we hope that she is listening out there somewhere.\n\nThe motion that was passed by the House back in June was a very clear directive from the Parliament of Canada and the people's representatives to the Government of Canada to make sure that the definition of marriage does not change.\n\nIn Bill C-23 the government has ignored that directive from parliament. It has done nothing to strengthen the current definition of marriage in law. Bill C-23 provided the government with an opportunity to respond to the direction from parliament and secure the definition of marriage in federal legislation. This is important.\n\nPeople have become increasingly concerned that the definition of marriage in Canada needs to be strengthened and protected before the courts because of case rulings one after another that increasingly suggest that the opposite sex definition of marriage may soon be deemed unconstitutional by the courts. In the last two years alone, 84 members of the House have presented petition after petition totalling thousands of names, calling for parliament to enact legislation to define that marriage can only be entered into between a single male and a single female. The people of Canada are speaking.\n\nAre Canadians overreacting or do they have justifiable concerns? Let us examine some of the recent events that have added to public concern about the erosion of the definition and concepts related to marriage.\n\nUntil recently Canadians understood the word spouse to be either a husband or a wife in a marriage. I can point to the immigration bill that was recently introduced in the House, Bill C-63, which would give the minister and the bureaucracy under her the power to define what a spouse is, whatever they deemed it to be that particular day.\n\nBill C-78 was pushed through the House. It was the 52nd bill the government forced closure on. It dealt with the public service pension plan. The bill removed every reference to wife, widow or spouse and replaced them with the word survivor in order to extend benefits previously reserved for marriage to same sex relationships.\n\nIn the fall the Minister of Human Resources Development went beyond the Canada Pension Plan Act to extend pension plan benefits normally reserved for married couples to same sex relationships, even though there was no legal or legislative authorization to do so.\n\nIn addition, a number of court cases have served to erode the distinctiveness of marriage and the concepts, rights and obligations tied to it. Many Canadians are concerned about this trend. The petitions are evidence of that.\n\nIn the courts, the Liberals refused to appeal a tax code case, known as the Rosenberg case. A provincial court redefined spouse to mean two people of the opposite sex or the same sex, even though every dictionary, including all the legal dictionaries, have always understood and still do understand spouse to be either a husband or a wife in a marriage. But the justice minister across the way, her law, the federal law, chose not to appeal the new definition of spouse.\n\nCanadians are watching this trend. Some say the last thing that remains is the full blown establishment of homosexual marriage in Canada as a normative practice. It becomes somewhat self-evident that sooner or later the opposite sex definition of marriage will be challenged in the courts. If the courts can rule that the way Canadians use the word spouse is unconstitutional and must include a same sex definition of spouse, why could they not rule that the current definition of marriage is unconstitutional unless it includes same sex and possibly a variety of other relationships as well?\n\nDue to the lack of accountable leadership from the Liberal government, the courts end up setting social policy often derived from a single case using charter arguments. The Liberal government follows the courts with legislation saying that the courts made the government do it. The people of Canada are totally left out of the process.\n\nMarriage as it has been defined throughout history is significant to people for a variety of reasons. It would be presumptuous of me to attempt to adequately capture all the values and the rationale Canadians have that are associated with why the current definition of marriage is so important to them. It is enough to say that the institution of marriage has been important to Canadian society from the very beginning of our nation.\n\nIn marriage a man in relationship to a woman gains the insights, sensitivities and strengths that she brings to the relationship and vice versa. A lifelong committed union of a man and a woman in marriage creates a unit that is stronger than the sum of the individuals because their differences complement each other.\n\nIn Corbett v Corbett the court said that marriage is an institution upon which the family is built. In other court cases the importance of marriage has been underlined. Let me reference a comment made by Justice La Forest in the Egan case where he said:\n\nThe legal institution of marriage exists both for the protection of the relationship and for defining the obligations that flow from entering into a legal marriage. Because of its importance, legal marriage may properly be viewed as fundamental to the stability and well-being of the family and, as such, parliament may quite properly give special support to the institution of marriage.\n\nThe kind of positive character modelling we see in marriage with access to both genders does not stay confined to the home but continues with children outside the home and adds a stabilizing and strengthening component to all of society. Recent Statistics Canada studies report that children in home relationships with both parents, mother and dad, have far fewer behavioural problems and a significantly higher percentage complete high school. Marriage is more than just a legal concept defined here; it is an institution that works for families.\n\nAccording to a 1991 review of research in the American Journal of Orthopsychiatry competency levels of children are influenced more by the quality and quantity of their interaction with their parents than by the parents' income or occupation or any other social variables. What kids need from their parents is mainly the parents themselves.\n\nIn the 1986 book Single Mothers and Their Children political scientist Sara McLanahan found that teenage girls raised with their fathers are far less likely to get in trouble. Fatherless girls are 111% more likely to get pregnant and 164% are more likely to become single mothers. A girl needs her father. We can make the same argument for the influence of mothers on children.\n\nIt is also interesting to note that a recent study of young people in Canada found that they aspire to have strong families. In a recent poll 93% of youth predicted that their family would be the most important part of their life. Eighty percent believe that the currently defined marriage between a man and a woman is for life.\n\nLet me also share a comment from one of the editors of a paper in my own city. It captures well the importance of marriage and why marriage needs to be clearly defined in legislation which does not currently exist at the federal level. That is one of the major improvements that is needed to Bill C-23.\n\nLet me quote from Peter Menzies of the Calgary Herald . He says:\n\nLaws defining marriage and common-law relationships were not designed just to protect the interests of two people involved in an intimate relationship. They were designed primarily to protect the interests of children. This is because heterosexual intimacy alone results in babies.\n\nSocieties decided to do this because: a) procreation is fundamental to the biological survival of the species, and, b) it is by consensus and statistical fact in the best interests of the cultural survival of the species to have its offspring raised in a stable home involving a mother and a father who have made a commitment to each other in sickness and health, until death do them part. That is because society has decided, through tradition and experience, that a male-female marriage is a form of relationship—due to its procreative nature and the depth of commitment required—best suited to act as a societal cornerstone, from a biological and cultural point of view.\n\nTo marry, you must be willing to make a lifelong monogamous commitment to the person of the opposite sex. Commitment, monogamy and possibly procreative sex are all typically necessary. If one, the procreative restriction, is not—as the court believes—justifiable in a free and democratic society, then surely monogamy and commitment are just as discriminatory against polygamous and those who wish to keep their options open.\n\nNone of this guarantees that all marriages result in perfectly functional families or that non-married relationships are by definition dysfunctional. Statistics, however, support the broadly-held view that—in general—the marriage model remains worthy of the exclusivity society has granted it, even though an increasing number of people prefer—and are free to—live otherwise.\n\nMarriage is important. Marriage is good for kids and marriage needs to be defined in legislation. This is important to Canadians. We have seen the trend.\n\nI want to get back to the concerns that many of the petitioners have raised in the House. It is reasonable for them to assume, based on the trends they have seen, that some day there will be a constitutional challenge to strike down the opposite sex definition of marriage in Canada, but why wait until that happens? Why continue to let the courts lead, as the Liberal government chooses to do on a regular basis, not just on this topic but on many topics? Why not respond? Why not let parliament for once lead instead of having the courts lead? Why not let the voice of the people represented by their elected representatives be what sets the agenda, as opposed to the courts always leading?\n\nIf we do not act now, when the courts say later that the charter made them do it, then the Liberals say that the courts made them do it, the question of using the notwithstanding clause will come up again. Would the Liberal government use the notwithstanding clause to defend the current definition of marriage?\n\nClearly, the Liberals have a position that seems to say that they will never use it. They will do everything in their power to make sure no one else does as well.\n\nIt is interesting that Premier Klein of Alberta recently made a pronouncement that if the courts ever ruled in favour of same sex marriage, he would invoke the notwithstanding clause. That is encouraging, but will we ever hear that from the federal government?\n\nIt is important to note that the provincial government has the authority to perform or solemnize marriages, but it is the federal government that determines what marriage is. Currently there is no federal statute that states that marriage must be between a man and a woman. Marriage is defined simply in common law, by case law, by judges. It has been decided in the courts over the years that it is a union of a man and a woman, to the exclusion of all others.\n\nIn light of the court's demonstrated willingness to redefine language and write into law within the context of the charter and there determine what is “reasonable”, it is clearly reasonable for the people's representatives in this parliament to proactively define in legislation that the definition of marriage must remain the union of a man and a woman to the exclusion of all others.\n\nUnfortunately, because the justice minister did not take the opportunity, Bill C-23 does exactly that, to follow the lead and the expressed will of the House to do that. If, and some would say when, the day comes that the Liberal appointed judges determine that limiting marriage to opposite sex partners is unconstitutional, having marriage defined in statute rather than in common law will allow for the expeditious use of the notwithstanding clause to uphold the legislation. Without an existing definition of marriage in statute, one would have to be drafted and put in place if the common law was overridden by a new ruling of the court. Therefore, why are we waiting?\n\nBill C-23 is a perfect opportunity for the government to act on the vote held here last June that called on the government to do everything possible to protect the current definition of marriage. I remind the House that it was four to one in favour of that motion. There was a large majority in favour that expressed the will of the Canadian people. This is an opportunity to put the statute in place that defines marriage. There would definitely be broad support in the House if the government would include marriage legislation as part of Bill C-23.\n\nI will move to the second aspect of Bill C-23 which warrants examination and substantial reworking. This part of the bill is so horrendously weak, so ludicrous that it is hardly possible to rework it, but we will try to work with this as best we can. I am talking about the part of the bill that defines the new concept of a common law partner.\n\nBill C-23 defines in statute that a common law partner is an individual person who is cohabiting with another individual in a conjugal relationship, having so cohabited for a period of at least one year. To put this in layman's terms, this basically says that if I live with someone and I have some sort of a conjugal relationship with the person, I now have a common law partner. It does not matter if it is a man or a woman, as long as we live in a house for a year and have some sort of conjugal relationship I now have a common law partner.\n\nBill C-23 extends every benefit and obligation that we currently have in place for marriage and for family to this new common law partner definition: under the same roof, conjugal relationship. Except for the Divorce Act, there is no difference between a married relationship and a common law partner relationship in the way government policy looks at those relationships.\n\nThere are many types of gender relationships: siblings, friends, roommates, partners, et cetera. However, the only relationship the government wants to include is when two people of the same gender are involved in a private sexual activity, or what is more commonly known as homosexuality. No sex and no benefits is the government's approach to this bill. Even if everything else is the same, even if there is a long time cohabitation and dependency, if there is no sex there are no benefits.\n\nBill C-23 is a benefits for sex bill. It is crazy. Under Bill C-23, benefits will be extended to any person who has had, as the bill says, a conjugal relationship, regardless of sex. It could be male, it could be female, it could be two males or two females. The bill refers to the phrase “conjugal relationship”.\n\nAccording to Black's Law Dictionary , conjugal means sexual activity. That is how ever major Canadian dictionary defines it, but the bill does not define it in any way. It does not make reference to the definition. It just uses the term and throws it back to the courts. It has added a new legal expression: A relationship of a conjugal nature. With absolutely no definition of what it means in the bill, we are left to assume that it means what Canadian dictionaries tell us. The government seems determined to make private sexual activity between two people, regardless of gender, the primary condition for benefits, which is what Bill C-23 does.\n\nBill C-23 is a compliance verification nightmare. Given that sexual relations seem to be the sole criteria for obtaining benefits, one wonders how the government will know whether a couple is truly having a conjugal relationship or simply trying to obtain a benefit.\n\nBecause of the difficulties in proving the conjugal aspect of the benefits equation, the government would be opening up a whole new front of litigation in the future. Upon one cohabitant moving out of a shared residence, he or she could find himself or herself in a position of having to prove that there were no conjugal relations if his or her former roommate claimed common law partner status. That is not too different from the recent M. v H. case we saw ruled on in the supreme court.\n\nIn addition, these new common law partners are not required to register anywhere in order to qualify or claim benefits, nor are there provisions for information sharing between federal departments. Thus couples could apply for conjugal benefits under one piece of legislation, while maintaining they were simply roommates or friends for another piece of legislation. That might impose some of the obligations that the justice minister waxed so eloquently about.\n\nThis legislation would allow these people to say that they are conjugal to get the benefit, but because there is no information sharing they do not have any of the obligations. They are saying that they are just roommates or friends in another piece of legislation. This does not work.\n\nWhat about all the people who are left out? The minister talks about equality and fairness. Let me share a story.\n\nI have an elderly gentleman in my riding who was a friend and was down on his luck. This is a senior who is living on a meagre pension. A wealthier person took him in as a friend. They have been sharing accommodation for years. They basically share everything in that household. They have a deep friendship, but it has never crossed their minds, and I doubt if it ever will, for these two men to have any kind of physical physical intimacy or sexual relationship.",

            "text": "Madam Speaker, with respect to the comment made by the member behind me, that is exactly what would be required for them to qualify under Bill C-23. Bill C-23 totally excludes the kind of relationship that I just spoke about.\n\nThe only way for survivor benefits or any of the benefits to be extended to a person who might otherwise be dependent on the public purse is for these two gentlemen to enter into some sort of physical intimacy or sex which they do not want to even entertain. They are left out of this. This is the equality bill. This is equality and fairness, as the justice minister says.\n\nThe bill leaves out all kinds of people. The sole criteria is, is it conjugal, is there sex. It is inappropriate and unworkable. If the government is intent on extending some benefits, it would be better to extend them based on some stated dependency agreement which people voluntarily enter into rather than have them excluded all together, which is what Bill C-23 does. Without this consideration of dependency, dependency really means nothing in Bill C-23 and sexual activity is a qualifier as I have said.\n\nI remember when Bill C-78 went through the House. It had a similar kind of approach to this issue. I questioned the treasury board minister at the time in committee. I asked him about it and he responded kind of weakly and kind of meekly that the courts made him do it, that the lawyers wrote it this way.\n\nDoes the government serve the people by letting the courts set policy and the lawyers draft the legislation in the whole process? Where is the voice of the people? It is not there. We are not hearing it. The Liberals do not want to hear it.\n\nWe launched a lot of committees across the country to get input from people, to hear what they had to say. I remember being a member of the committee that travelled from coast to coast on the issue of custody and access situations that had to be dealt with in divorce. We heard from hundreds, if not over a thousand Canadians, their input on what needed to be done to restructure family law to cope better with marital breakdown and make the law more beneficial to families with these kinds of problems.\n\nI know that members of the House travelled with all kinds of committees. The finance committee travels every year to hear input from Canadians. Here we have a piece of legislation that changes 68 statutes and will affect 20 different departments, and what are they taking as their guide? They have an Angus Reid poll that is telling them that this is what people want.\n\nAngus Reid predicted that Mike Harris would lose the Ontario election. Angus Reid said the Liberals would win in Ontario, and they lost. This is what they are using as the basis for justification for bringing forward a bill that affects 68 statutes and 20 areas of the government. They do not want to have any public consultation on it.\n\nThe minister talked a bit about public consultation at the end of her speech, but she is implementing a bill without any of it. What I suggest is that the government put it on hold. Let us hear what the people have to say. Let us launch a committee. There are 68 statutes being changed. How about some public hearings, public input?\n\nI am reminded too of the comprehensive report we put together on the custody and access committee. There was a lot of agreement around the table by all members of the House. There was a whole screed of recommendations. The justice minister said she would not act on it because she wanted to think about it. Maybe in another three years or so we will do something with it.\n\nThat is the voice of the people coming through the committee process being shelved. The bill says that they like the results of a poll, the court told them to do it. Boom, it is done and people are shut out. Bill C-23 is weak because the Liberals have not allowed the people to have input.\n\nI remind members opposite and all other members that every word spoken in the House is recorded and bound in volumes which are kept in the Speaker's office. Everything we say and every vote is recorded. In a sense it is our accountability. In a sense we might say it is a legacy we leave to our families and those who follow that may want to reference what we said and where we stood on issues.\n\nI ask members to consider their positions on Bill C-23. It takes every benefit and every obligation we currently extend to marriage and families and gives them to two people living together for a year, provided they have sex.\n\nThe bill needs to be sent back for a redraft. It needs to include a clear definition in law, in legislation, that marriage is the union of a man and a woman to the exclusion of all others. Let us get that in the statute. That is what people have asked for in petitions. That is what the House has voted in support of. It is time to do it. Unfortunately the justice minister has missed an opportunity to do exactly that.\n\nIt also needs to be redrafted to include respect for people's private intimacies. To make benefits subject to the private sexual activities of individuals is clearly inappropriate in our opinion. If the government is intent on drafting legislation to allow benefits to flow to relationships between two people of the same gender and to make benefits contingent upon their having some sort of sexual relationship, it is inappropriate.\n\nIs it not more reasonable to focus on demonstrated interdependencies and the social contribution of the relationship when considering benefits rather than on the private physical intimacies of the person being considered? I believe, Mr. Speaker, you would even agree with that.\n\nI encourage all members of the House to send Bill C-23 back for an improved redraft. Let us protect marriage in legislation and let us focus on dependency, not on conjugality. In its current form this is an unworkable piece of legislation.",

            "text": "Mr. Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I rise to speak to this bill, and I hasten to congratulate the government on finally taking action to respect human rights.\n\nThroughout the debate that is beginning today, many speakers, particularly from this side of the House, from among the Reform Party members, will try to persuade us that this is a bill that undermines the rights of the family, that undermines the institution of marriage, and that it is therefore an unacceptable bill.\n\nI believe that one would have to be of singularly bad faith not to recognize that the bill before us today is a bill relating to human rights. It states that, in future, parliament, the lawmakers, this lofty decision-making centre that is the House of Commons, will not accept any form of discrimination whatsoever toward same sex partners.\n\nThat is what we are speaking of here. The purpose of the bill we have before us is to amend 68 pieces of legislation in all sectors of life in Canada and in Quebec, whether the Criminal Code, the Citizenship Act, pension plans, banks, all sectors of society, anywhere there is a “heterosexist” definition of spouse, so that in future, if this bill goes through, there will be a “homosexist” definition.\n\nI respectfully submit that this has nothing to do with the family, nothing to do with marriage. That does not mean that one day down the road we will not have to debate that as parliamentarians. I do not hesitate to state that, in my opinion, parenting ability has nothing to do with sexual orientation. They are two completely different things.\n\nHowever, that is not what we are dealing with today. I believe it is very important to be extremely clear about this, for the benefit of our fellow citizens. There is, however, one point on which I am forced to agree with our Reform Party colleagues: it was high time for the legal activism that started back in the early 1990s to come to an end, and high time for us to assume our responsibilities as parliamentarians.\n\nIn all the judgments pronounced in recent years, be it in the Haig case, the Nesbit-Egan case in 1995, the Rosenberg case or, more recently, the M. v H. case, the various courts of justice, and often the supreme court, have told parliamentarians to fulfil their obligations.\n\nI am very pleased, first of all because there are pioneers in this House who have paved the way. In that regard, I believe we must pay tribute to the hon. member for Burnaby—Douglas. Once the way was paved, a movement started to emerge.\n\nLet us ask ourselves the question. For the second time in less than a decade, parliamentarians will be voting on the recognition of same sex spouses. The previous time was in 1995. Yours truly, who was still very green as a member of parliament, having been elected in 1993, had asked his parliamentary colleagues to pass a motion asking that the government and the House recognize same sex spouses.\n\nAt the time, no more than 55 parliamentarians voted in favour of the motion. All members of the NDP voted in favour, as did 85% of the members of the Bloc. What is significant—and I do not mean this to be a breach of our rules, I mention it strictly for information purposes—is that, except for the Minister of Canadian Heritage, there were no cabinet members in the House when the vote took place.\n\nI mention this for information purposes, to show the incredible progress made, resulting in the Minister of Justice, and she is to be commended for that, coming before the House today with a commitment from cabinet and asking us to support an act recognizing same sex spouses.\n\nThe Minister of Justice is able today to table a bill like this one because of a change brought about by people speaking out.\n\nYesterday morning, I took part in a press conference held in Montreal, in the gay village, by the Coalition pour la reconnaissance des conjoints du même sexe. I said to these people “Same sex partners will be recognized, and parliamentarians will take this profoundly significant step because individuals and groups in society have spoken out and said they were involved in same sex relationships, they were living true love with all of its heights and its depths, with its obligations and its benefits, and demanded to be given full consideration”.\n\nWhen we come to this debate, when we vote and when we consider this bill in parliamentary committee, I would like all parliamentarians, especially the Reform members, to ask themselves the following question: Can we decently, in all knowledge, argue in this House that two men or two women who love each other feel love differently from a man and woman who love each other?\n\nThere is no difference in the feeling of love. There is no difference in the way couples live. A man in love with another man feels the same range of emotions, experiences the same feelings. An individual living in society pays the same taxes, is governed by the same laws and participates in the same civil society. This must be the focus of our concerns.\n\nNon-recognition of same sex partners is a matter of discrimination. It cannot be a matter of religion. We cannot, as parliamentarians, take a religious or moral stand on this issue, which does not mean that we are not people of principle.\n\nAs an individual, I have my principles. I have my values. My colleagues have their principles and their values. But when one is passing a bill, when one is a lawmaker, it cannot be issues of morality that guide us, because, in politics, such issues are the most likely to suffer from the passage of time.\n\nLet us consider what would have happened if those who passed the Divorce Act had allowed themselves to become hung up on moral considerations and had decided not to pass the legislation because the predominant moral stance thirty years ago did not approve of people being able to dissolve their marriage through a legal mechanism.\n\nOne principle alone must guide us as lawmakers and that is equality between individuals. This is how the Minister of Justice started off her speech. We cannot agree on constitutional issues and, as members know, we are unhappy about Bill C-20. We cannot reach agreement with respect to the economy. We do not see eye to eye on economic policy, but it is impossible that we, as parliamentarians, cannot agree on what should motivate our actions, what should be at the heart of our concerns, and that is the equality of all individuals.\n\nThis principle is so important, so deserving of our attention, that the lawmakers, acting as a constituent body in 1981-82, enshrined it in the legislation.\n\nSo that this is clear for those listening, the principle of recognizing same sex spouses flows not just from extremely noble sentiments between individuals, that is reciprocal love, but from the recognition enshrined in section 15 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.\n\nGiven its importance, I am going to quote it to you, if I may. What does section 15 say? It reads as follows:\n\nEvery individual is equal before and under the law and has the right to the equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination and, in particular, without discrimination based on race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, age or mental or physical disability.\n\nThat is the text that existed in 1982. I would point out as an aside that, at the time of the constitutional conferences as far back as 1982, some people were grouping together. Who was the Minister of Justice at that time? The present Prime Minister and member for Shawinagan.\n\nAs far back as 1982, people were lobbying to have sexual orientation included in the illegal grounds for discrimination. This was not done, but I will not go into that any further. In 1995 there was a cause célèbre, probably one of the most important cases in Canadian law: Nesbitt-Egan. This concerned a British Columbia couple—British Columbia being one of the most interesting places to live in Canada—who had been living together for more than 40 years. Not many couples have been together more than 40 years.\n\nThis was a homosexual union, a couple who had been living together for more than 40 years. One of them challenged the constitutionality of one of the sections of the Old Age Security Act dealing with the spouses' allowance, claiming that it was unconstitutional under section 15, which I have just quoted.\n\nThe supreme court unanimously—all nine justices—acknowledged that indeed, in future, section 15 of the 1982 Charter of Human Rights had to be read as including sexual orientation among the illegal grounds for discrimination.\n\nThat is how the supreme court came to acknowledge that it was no longer possible for the lawmakers to discriminate, on the basis of section 15. This was a very great moment in the annals of legal history.\n\nToday as parliamentarians we must, naturally, with the distance that must accompany our deliberations and in the direction the supreme court has indicated, tell our fellow citizens that we will not tolerate discrimination.\n\nLet us be clear. It is never easy to acknowledge one is different from others. It is never easy to belong to a minority, and it is no easier belonging to a sexual minority. I am 37. I know I look very young. I regularly have to show proof of age at clubs, but nevertheless, I am 37.\n\nWhen I told my parents at age 18 that I was a homosexual it was not easy for me and it was not easy for my parents either. Let us go back in time. My parents had raised children in the early 1960s. I turned 18 in the early 1980s, and I do not think that my parents in their ideals of raising family and having children in the 1950s, 1960s or 1970s had wanted a homosexual son, because it was a period in which society rejected homosexuals. Homosexuality was considered an illness. People made fun of homosexuals.\n\nThat did not prevent my parents from moving on and understanding that homosexual relationships may be extremely gratifying and that we are full citizens.\n\nThis is the whole thrust of the debate today. Every member rising in this House to vote against Bill C-23 will send a negative message to Canadians and Quebecers, who will think that when one is gay, one does not deserve full protection in every piece of legislation passed by parliament.\n\nThis is the message that these members will send when they vote against this bill. Let us not forget that even in optimum conditions, when one discovers that one is gay, at age 13, 14 or 15, it cannot be easy. It is in our interest as lawmakers to contribute to a better acceptance of each other, to help people accept each other for who they are, to see that people reach their full potential. This is why the legal framework defined by us lawmakers must promote the development of individuals.\n\nAgain, this, in my opinion, is the thrust of the debate. As parliamentarians, do we accept the view that people engaged in homosexual relationships with same sex partners must be recognized as full fledged members of society? Make no mistake about it. This is not a financial issue, not a monetary issue. Of course, the benefits to be provided by the act will have a financial impact, since the Canada Pension Plan Act will be amended.\n\nSo will the Income Tax Act, to make it possible for a same sex spouse to get a spousal allowance, to receive compensation. This will become possible and it will also be possible to claim a deduction for a dependent spouse.\n\nHowever, the bill's financial impact is not its main feature. Those who may be tempted to vote against it cannot argue, if they are properly informed, that this bill will have a major impact on the treasury.\n\nLet us never forget that, in a number of cases, same sex spouses who will be granted benefits are already paying for these benefits as taxpayers.\n\nIn 1998, at the time of the Rosenberg case, when the Department of Finance was asked to evaluate the financial impact of recognizing same sex spouses, what did it say? First, there is obviously no one right now who can give a precise evaluation of what it would cost Canadian taxpayers to recognize same sex couples.\n\nIt is not possible because no one has a clear idea of the number of homosexual couples in Canadian society. It does not exist in the census and it is not something one declares in one's tax return.\n\nOn the basis of evaluations done by the Department of Finance on the consumer habits of Canadians, it is estimated that, if between 2% and 6% of Canadians took advantage of the various tax deductions that could apply to same sex couples, the cost would range between $4 million and $12 million.\n\nSo this is not primarily a financial or monetary issue, because we are talking about an amount between $4 million and $12 million, according to the figures filed with the Ontario Court of Appeal in the Rosenberg case.\n\nI also wish to give a bit of background so that people are clear about what we are discussing. The term homosexual itself goes back to 1869. The word originated in Germany, apparently.\n\nMore recently, in 1948, a sexologist and sociologist by the name of Kinsey published a report in which he said that something like 10% of the population might have engaged in homosexual relations.\n\nIn 1969, the government amended Canada's Criminal Code, decriminalizing homosexual acts between consenting individuals over the age of 21.\n\nThese historical landmarks are important to a proper understanding of how this all came about and of how long ago the recognition we are now preparing to give to same sex couples began, how deeply it has been rooted in history, and how long.\n\nImagine, Canada had its first gay demonstration on Parliament Hill as far back as 1971. In 1973—just to show what a tenacious prejudice this has been—the American Psychology Association removed homosexuality from its list of definitions of abnormal behaviour.\n\nFrom the early 1950s until the mid-1970s, when the medical profession dealt with homosexuality, it considered it pathological. Today, who could argue that homosexuality is pathological?\n\nAs hon. members are aware, I myself am of homosexual orientation, and I do not believe that I have ever presented any sign of dysfunctional behaviour, unless it is to sometimes be a bit long-winded, but I do not think anyone would fault me for that.\n\nIn 1977, Quebec amended its legislation, its human rights charter, in order to include sexual orientation among the forbidden grounds of discrimination.\n\nIn 1979, the Canadian Human Rights Commission recommended in its annual report that the Canadian Human Rights Act be amended to include sexual orientation. And that is interesting. It must be kept in mind that the Canadian Human Rights Commission played a fundamental role in obtaining more rights for the homosexual community.\n\nThis leads me to point out that the Haig case in the early 1990s was really because of the Canadian Human Rights Act, and section 10 of that legislation was struck down because it did not put an end to discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.\n\nIt must be pointed out that, at the time, it was Kim Campbell who was the Minister of Justice. She decided that a decision that could have applied only to Ontario would be binding throughout Canada. We must be grateful to Kim Campbell for being open-minded.\n\nWe know of course what happened in 1982. In 1985, section 15 came into force but, unfortunately, it did not include sexual orientation as a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n\nIn 1986, Ontario became the second province, after Quebec, to amend its human rights code, which is the equivalent of Quebec's charter of human rights, and to include sexual orientation as a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n\nIn 1988, a breath of fresh air came from the church. The United Church of Canada, which represents the largest Protestant community in Canada, voted in favour of ordaining homosexuals.\n\nThis is how a society changes. It is truly the joint forces of the judiciary, the church, the political institutions and society that contribute to the shaping of mentalities.\n\nIn 1989, a court recognized for the first time that sexual orientation was a prohibited ground of discrimination under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.\n\nIn 1991, Ontario extended its social benefits, with the exception of surviving spouse benefits, to same sex spouses for the whole provincial public service.\n\nAt the same time, the Supreme Court of British Columbia decided that the interpretation of “spouse” as defined in the Medical Service Act, which denied same sex partners the benefits provided, was an infringement of section 15.\n\nOne year later, in 1992, a commission of inquiry established under the authority of the Ontario Human Rights Code held that the refusal to give survivor benefits to same sex partners contravened the charter.\n\nThis is how the issue of sexual orientation gradually worked its way through the annals of law and into the charter.\n\nIn 1995, there was the Nesbit-Egan decision. This is not an insignificant decision, and I would like to cite it. I remind the hon. members that this decision arose from action taken by a British Columbia couple who had lived together for over 40 years. Mr. Speaker, I am sure that you, a model of fidelity, have not yet reached so many years.\n\nThe supreme court found that sexual orientation ought to be included in section 15 as prohibited grounds for discrimination. It is because the supreme court included sexual orientation as prohibited grounds for discrimination that—",

            "text": "Mr. Speaker, I hope my time has not been shortened and that you stopped the clock when our colleague rose. He has put me a bit off track, but I will resume my remarks.\n\nAnother very famous decision in the annals of law advanced the cause of the gays.\n\nThat was the decision in the case of Rosenberg v Canada. On April 23, 1998, the Ontario Court of Appeal ruled unanimously that the definition of “spouse” in the Income Tax Act was unconstitutional as it applied to registered pension plans.\n\nThe words “of the opposite sex” in the definition as it existed in the Income Tax Act prevented the Canadian Union of Public Employees from extending the application of its registered pension plans to the surviving spouses of gay or lesbian employees.\n\nThe Canadian Union of Public Employees therefore relied on section 15 in challenging the discrimination which had taken place, the result of which was that the Department of National Revenue, which administers the Income Tax Act, refused to recognize same sex employees' registered pension plans, thus denying them the corresponding deduction and the plans legal recognition. Once again, the courts enlightened matters.\n\nMore recently, another extremely important decision was handed down in the case of M. v H. On May 20, 1999, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled eight to one in favour. This was an extremely strong show of support. The judges were not divided. This was not a decision with a slim majority, but an extremely solid one, almost unanimous, one of only a few supreme court decisions, with eight justices out of nine ruling that the definition of “spouse” in the Ontario Family Law Act contravened section 15 of the Canadian Charter of Human Rights.\n\nWhat was involved here? Two lesbians had been living as a couple for several years, since the early 1980s. They broke up. It should be pointed out that, during their life together, wealth had been accumulated, and one of the two had acquired a business for which the other worked. Therefore, support payments were demanded at the time they broke up. Obviously, the Ontario legislation known as the Family Law Act, at section 29 if I remember correctly, did not recognize same sex partners, and so, despite having lived with a same sex partner for some years and having contributed to the wealth of the couple, the woman had no recourse.\n\nIt is interesting that this went all the way to the supreme court. Why am I taking the time to refer to the decision in M. v H.? Because, for the first time, the supreme court acknowledged that homosexual relationships should be considered as spousal relationships. And it was recognized that, ultimately, it would be possible for support payments to be obtained in the case of same sex couples.\n\nHowever, the supreme court showed some reservations, as the provincial court had earlier in the Nesbit-Egan case, and refused to invalidate the act completely, or to require the Government of Ontario to amend all of its legislation. It made a declaratory judgment limited to section 29 for a 90-day period. Hon. members will see that the court was exhibiting wisdom.\n\nM. v H. is an important decision because it makes it clear to the homosexual community that justice is aptly represented by a scale with two sides, since it involves both obligations and benefits.\n\nWe must know as parliamentarians, and the homosexual community must know, that if this bill is passed, it will also lead to obligations. When a couple's total income is taken into account, there may be advantages and disadvantages arising from considering the total income, for example.\n\nM. v H. is a case involving support. When an individual enters a homosexual relationship, consideration must be given to what may arise should the relationship break up after a period of time. There are a number of responsibilities.\n\nI would like to return to the heart of the debate. Once again, I believe that we would be mistaken as parliamentarians if we failed to recognize that the issue here is to put an end to discrimination once and for all. We know that the ten major cities, including Halifax, Vancouver, Montreal, Toronto and Moncton, have recognized same sex partners at the municipal level.\n\nMany private firms recognize same sex partners. The situation would be paradoxical to say the least if same sex partners were recognized by lower level authorities, at the municipal level for example, but not by us here, in the federal government, in the Parliament of Canada.\n\nMore recently, last year, the National Assembly, with the government of Lucien Bouchard, one of the best governments to have occupied the government benches, gave full recognition to same sex partners. It amended 28 laws of Quebec, including the act respecting income security and the automobile insurance act. Major pieces of legislation were amended in order to recognize same sex partners.\n\nObviously the process is not complete, since the civil code remains to be changed. I cannot wait for that, and I am eager to get Mr. Bouchard's government moving on to the next step, that of amending the Civil Code of Quebec. As hon. members are aware, we have two separate legal systems: one based on common law, which governs English Canada; one governing Quebec, the civil code. This code is a law, but it does not recognize heterosexual partners, and so obviously it does not recognize homosexual partners.\n\nI am anxious to convince the Quebec government to jump on the band wagon and amend the civil code. Again, this is not about family or marriage. Earlier, I listened to what the Reform Party members were saying, and I think some serious soul-searching is in order, because one cannot promote law and order as they do and not want to respect the charter. That is not possible.\n\nYesterday at a press conference the Canadian Coalition for the Recognition of Same Sex Spouses stressed how untimely and inappropriate it would be for parliamentarians to vote against this bill. By voting against this bill, parliamentarians will in fact be indicating that they think they are above the Canadian charter. This means they do not recognize a value that is fundamental, regardless of where one lives in Canada, of one's profession, of one's age and of one's judicial record. There is a principle that must be adhered to, and that is equality for all.\n\nIt can never be overstated that this bill enshrines the recognition of full, total and uncompromising equality for all. I cannot imagine the Reformers, who will very soon opt for the united alternative, sending the gay people in Alberta, Saskatchewan and British Columbia the message that, as parliamentarians, they do not recognize them as full-fledged citizens.\n\nI believe there will be an extremely heavy price to pay in terms of the implications. I believe that voters will be very critical of members who rise in this House and do not recognize that the principle of equality between individuals applies to all citizens and that this equality should be the focus of our concerns.\n\nThe Bloc Quebecois will do everything it can to have this bill passed quickly, because recognition of same sex spouses has been too long in coming. We will examine the issue seriously in committee. We will hear from witnesses.\n\nAll those who believe in equality must do something that is extremely important in democracy and that is to speak up. We must rise up and engage in dialogue at every opportunity. We must go to see the Reform Party members and all parliamentarians who are not convinced that the bill has merit. We must engage in dialogue in order to convince them that this has nothing to do with marriage and the family, but that it is a matter of equality.\n\nIn the coming days, that is what I will be doing. That is what all parliamentarians should be doing. I am convinced that together we can change things, shape thinking and work for greater equality for all our fellow citizens.",

            "text": "Madam Speaker, it is with a sense of pride that I rise in my place today to congratulate the government in introducing this legislation.\n\nThe road to full equality for gay and lesbian people has been long, frequently difficult and turbulent. We are not there yet, but this bill advances significantly the gay and lesbian community on the road to full equality.\n\nIn achieving this important milestone I want to acknowledge the contribution of many Canadians.\n\nI congratulate the member for Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, who has just spoken. He is an excellent MP, who has long fought for recognition for same sex spouses and who has introduced a number of bills to that effect.\n\nI acknowledge the contribution of a deputy who is not here today, Shaughnessy Cohen, who tragically died in the House just after signing a letter to the Minister of Justice urging that the government move ahead to recognize the relationships of gay and lesbian people.\n\nI acknowledge the work done by the labour movement, unions such as the CAW, CUPE, the Public Service Alliance, la CSN au Quebec, CUPW, the Canadian Labour Congress, and in particular my friend Nancy Rich.\n\nThere are those who have lived their lives openly and proudly, often defying the ostracism of people in their communities who rejected their relationships. They are the unsung heroes and those who we honour as our leaders. They include people like Jane Rule and her partner Helen Sonthoff, who just died, and Jim Egan and his partner Jack Nesbitt, who took to the Supreme Court of Canada the issue of the recognition of gay and lesbian relationships, who have celebrated their lives together for over 40 years, and who won a landmark victory in affirming the inclusion of sexual orientation in our charter of rights.\n\nOthers who have taken their fight to the courts include Nancy Rosenberg and her partner; Margaret Evans and her partner; Stanley Moore and his partner, Pierre Soucy; Dale Akerstrom and his partner, Alexander; Chris Vogel in Manitoba; Jim Bigney in Nova Scotia; and Delwin Vriend.\n\nI could go on and on with the stories of heroes and those who have fought this courageous fight for full equality.\n\nI want to acknowledge as well a former colleague from the House. I first raised this issue over 20 years ago when I was first elected as a young member of the House. One of my earliest allies was a Conservative member of parliament, Pat Carney. I want to acknowledge her work.\n\nThere are some who ask why the government is doing this. The government is doing this because we as parliamentarians and provincial legislators gave the courts the duty and the responsibility of interpreting the charter of rights. They did not seize that; we gave them that responsibility. Indeed, the highest court in the land, the Supreme Court of Canada, has ruled that section 15 of our charter prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation and, as well, that that discrimination includes discrimination in the relationships of gay and lesbian people.\n\nEGALE, the national lobby group, the Campaign for Equal Families and other groups have advanced this cause before the courts, and legislatures in a number of provinces and jurisdictions have moved forward.\n\nThe Government of Quebec recently introduced an omnibus bill, and I wish to congratulate MNA André Boulerice in particular on his tireless efforts in this regard.\n\nThe Government of British Columbia has been one of the leaders in advancing the cause of equality, in particular attorney general Ujjal Dosanjh.\n\nIn Ontario former attorney general Marion Boyd brought forward Bill 167.\n\nThe legislation is a recognition by the government that it must move forward. It could fight every case in the courts, case by case, or it could do the right thing, the honourable thing, the just thing and say that yes, it recognizes that the courts have ruled. The courts have ruled that where benefits are extended to heterosexual common law couples, those benefits must as well be extended to those involved in committed, loving, same sex relationships.\n\nAs Justice Iacobucci noted in the case of Delwin Vriend v the Supreme Court of Canada:\n\nIn my opinion, groups that have historically been the target of discrimination cannot be expected to wait patiently for the protection of their human dignity and equal rights while governments move toward reform one step at a time. If the infringement of the rights and freedoms of these groups is permitted to persist while governments fail to pursue equality diligently, then the guarantees of the Charter will be reduced to little more than empty words.\n\nThat is what we are achieving today. It is a recognition that the guarantees of the charter must be made reality by changes in law, changes that involve both rights and responsibilities.\n\nI am very proud to stand here today on behalf of my New Democrat colleagues to say that this caucus has supported from the very beginning, certainly over the full 20 years that I have had the privilege of serving here, full equality for gay and lesbian people.\n\nThe leader of my party, the member for Halifax, has been in the forefront of this struggle, both as a provincial member in Nova Scotia and now as leader of the party, and each and every one of my colleagues has worked for full equality for gay and lesbian people.\n\nI stand here today not just as the member of parliament for Burnaby—Douglas, not just as a gay man, but also on behalf of my colleagues to say that we recognize and salute the government for this important contribution toward full equality.\n\nI want to say a couple words about what this bill is not about. This bill is not about special rights for anyone. It is about fairness and equal rights. It is a recognition that gay and lesbian people pay into benefit plans and, up until very recently, have been denied the benefits that should flow. Indeed, outside the House stands a man with a sign saying “No special rights for homosexuals—Repeal Bill C-23”. Again, I emphasize, this is not about special rights.\n\nThis is also not about money. If anything, Reformers should be supporting the bill because it will help to reduce the federal deficit and debt. According to a study that was tabled in the Rosenberg case, an affidavit that was signed by a senior tax policy officer in the Department of Finance said:\n\n—extending spousal tax treatment to same-sex couples would result in an overall cost savings to the federal government of about $10 million per year.\n\nThose are the facts from the Department of Finance. It does not cost money to extend equality because in this particular legislation we are recognizing both rights and responsibilities.\n\nIn M. v H. it was recognized that one lesbian partner had financial responsibilities to her former partner which flowed from that relationship. It is clear that, to the extent those responsibilities are recognized, that will reduce the financial burden on the state as well. I would have thought that would have been something the Reform Party would have welcomed and supported.\n\nThis is not about special rights. It is not about extra money. Most offensively, in the Reform Party's characterization the member for Calgary Centre said “This is benefits for sex”. Let me say how demeaning, how dishonest and how offensive that characterization of the bill really is for the Reform Party to say it is benefits for sex.\n\nLet us look at this for a minute. The member for Calgary Centre said “How do we prove they are actually partners? How do we prove they have actually been involved in a sexual relationship? What if they are trying to scam the system?” I remind the House that for some years now common law heterosexual relationships have been recognized. I have not heard the Reformers say “No, no, do not recognize those relationships because we cannot prove that the man and woman are involved in a sexual relationship. We cannot prove that they are really committed to one another”. No, they have been silent about common law heterosexual relationships because they know that many Canadians are involved in those relationships and they are not challenging those relationships.\n\nThe Reformers do not have the intellectual integrity to recognize the complete bankruptcy of their argument when they say “How do we prove this?”\n\nThen the member for Calgary Centre said “All you have to do is shack up with somebody for a year, have sex with that person and you will be recognized”. That is a totally false argument because the Supreme Court of Canada and the Ontario Court of Appeal have both talked about what a conjugal relationship means. Does it just mean living with somebody and having sex occasionally? No, it does not. Some conjugal relationships involve no sexual relationship at all. They are very clear about that. Some heterosexual couples are actually in loving, committed relationships and they do not have sexual relations. I know the member for Calgary Centre might find that an incredible revelation. That is amazing, is it not? Yet, those are conjugal relationships according to the courts.\n\nThe suggestion that benefits for sex is what this is all about trivializes and diminishes the quality of gay and lesbian relationships. My relationship with my partner, Max, is not just about living together and having sexual relations. Of course that is important, but it is much deeper and much more profound than that, and that is what makes, ultimately, a conjugal relationship. We share our lives, the good times and the bad, in sickness and in health. We share the ownership of our home. We have a joint bank account. We are beneficiaries in one another's wills.\n\nThere is a deep emotional commitment in that relationship which is trivialized and demeaned and denied by the kind of suggestions by the member for Calgary Centre. We are saying that these relationships should be recognized and affirmed and celebrated in this country and not denied any longer.\n\nI would note as well that each and every one of those members of parliament who is now speaking out against this bill is saying that they should oppose this bill because it does not go far enough, it does not recognize other dependent relationships like two sisters living together or two elderly gentlemen sharing a home. Without exception each and every one of those members has spoken against basic equality for gay and lesbian people. That is their agenda. They do not believe in it.\n\nEvery member of the Reform Party in the House today who was in this House during the vote on the Canadian Human Rights Act amendments, Bill C-33, voted against that bill. They do not believe in equality and let no one be fooled into suggesting otherwise. That is their agenda.\n\nOf course it is true that there is still not full equality. There is still much to be done. This bill does not deal with the immigration law for example. There are Canadians who fall in love with other Canadians and there are some who fall in love with citizens of other countries. I appeal to the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration to move forward quickly to recognize the relationships of gay and lesbian people in the new immigration act which will be tabled shortly. We must look seriously at the provisions of the criminal code with respect to hate literature as well.\n\nAnd yes, dare I say it, we must also recognize that couples who wish to involve themselves in committed loving relationships and have those affirmed by the state in marriage. That too is part of equality.\n\nThere are members on all sides of the House who say that no, marriage cannot be extended to gay and lesbian people as this would be the death of marriage, the downfall of the moral fabric of society. Is marriage really that fragile? How on earth would it threaten the marriage of the member for Calgary Centre or the marriage of the member from Ontario to recognize and affirm the relationships of gay and lesbian people who choose to marry? That will come as part of full equality. In the Netherlands the government has recently tabled a bill to extend those rights as well.\n\nI want to close by reading from a letter from a woman who speaks far more eloquently than I, with far more power and passion about what it has meant in her life to have her relationship denied full equality and why this bill is so important. I am proud to say that her name is Donna Wilson. She wrote a letter in 1996 to the Prime Minister saying this:\n\nDear Prime Minister:\n\nOn October 30, 1995 my life partner of more than 13 years died. She was diagnosed with ovarian cancer less than seven months prior to her death. Before that she was an active, healthy 48 year old woman.\n\nWe shared everything as life partners. We were emotionally and financially interdependent. Every aspect of our lives was connected, inter-related. We celebrated our lives together and were embraced by family, friends and many diverse communities.\n\nWe shared in the parenting of two children. I continue to care for them and support them as a co-parent myself and also on behalf of their mother who has died.\n\nOur relationship was rendered invisible time and time again by the laws in our country. We lived without the supports and benefits available to the vast majority of Canadians. There were no tax credits or benefits available to assist us as a couple or a family. There was no recognition of the value of our relationship, our family and our contributions to Canadian society.\n\nEven now I'm not considered a widow or survivor and I'm not eligible to receive my partner's pension. I know the same devastating grief as every other widow and I share the same financial fears and insecurities as many who survive the death of a spouse or life partner.\n\nAfter my partner died I contacted the office of the Canadian pension plan. With great pain I explained my circumstance. The woman at the other end of the phone expressed no condolences, no compassion. Instead, she stated that I wasn't eligible to receive pension benefits since “there was no surviving spouse”. When I restated that I was the surviving spouse she asked for my name and “the name of the deceased”. Two women's names confirmed it. “There was no surviving spouse”.\n\nOur 13 plus years together in a committed relationship meant nothing. My partner's wishes meant nothing. My needs as a survivor meant nothing.\n\nThroughout her life my partner was committed to employment that contributed to the lives of others. She paid into the Canadian pension plan. She wanted her pension contributions to be available for me, to assist me with recovering from care giving and to heal from grieving. She wanted to provide for my well-being as we had done for one another and our children throughout our relationship. She didn't want me to have to worry about moving right away and all the other things that many survivors/widows need to consider.\n\nPrior to my partner's death we discovered that her RRSP could not be rolled over into mine even though we were life partners and I was the designated beneficiary. My partner was very distraught to learn that upon her death our retirement savings would be deregistered and taxed at a high rate. She was angry that our retirement savings could not remain as such whereas a heterosexual couple, even a common law couple after only one year, would be able to roll over RRSPs from one spouse to the other.\n\nMy partner's outrage, sadness and concern motivated her to file a human rights complaint....\n\nI am currently preparing my partner's income tax return.\n\nShe points out that she will be responsible for paying taxes on almost half of her RRSP. It is a painful process in the midst of grieving. She said:\n\nWe hear so much these days about the need to take personal responsibility for ourselves in preparing for retirement. My partner and I were doing just that. Instead of being assisted by the government to prepare for later years it has now been made more difficult.\n\nUnder the law all Canadians pay taxes. We contribute to pension plans. We contribute to the welfare of others. Under the law lesbian and gay Canadians are denied the benefits and assistance associated with these contributions. And, under the law, our taxes and pension contributions assist and subsidize the privileged majority.\n\nMadam Speaker, I wonder if I might seek the consent of the House for one more minute just to finish reading this letter.",

In conclusion, Donna Wilson asked:\n\nWhen is the government going to recognize that lesbians and gay men have a right to the same benefits and assistance available to all other tax paying citizens? When is the government going to be honest with all Canadians and let them know that the rights of lesbians and gay men have already been recognized in the courts? When is the government going to put a stop to fear tactics and lies about financial resources being depleted if benefits and tax credits are extended to lesbians and gay men?\n\nThis isn't a matter of “special” rights or privileges. It's about recognizing the fullness of diversity within our communities and facing the fact that Canadian laws need to change in order to reflect current realities and the equality of all citizens. It's about putting an end to homophobia and heterosexism. It is about action, not lip service.\n\nIt's time for the government to act and to end all forms of discrimination against lesbian and gay Canadians.\n\nDonna speaks with eloquence and passion for gay and lesbian people across this land. They join with me today in commending the government and urging that the bill be adopted at the earliest possible time so that we can finally achieve much fuller equality for gay and lesbian people.",

I am pleased that the Minister of Justice has recognized this and I understand she is referring this issue to a committee for further study.\n\nThe case of a brother and sister who have lived together for many years and who are involved in a situation of economic dependence is something we can examine.

It responds to the Supreme Court of Canada particularly in the M. v H. decision and the earlier decision in Miron v Trudel. It recognizes that where benefits are extended and where there are obligations for common law heterosexual partners, that justice and equality means that those same benefits should be extended to same sex partners.

Is the hon. member for Calgary Centre and the Reform Party seriously suggesting that if for whatever reason that couple does not still have a sexual relationship that somehow that relationship is not a genuine common law relationship? That is absolutely ludicrous.\n\nIn fact the Supreme Court of Canada and the Ontario Court of Appeal have talked about what is involved in a conjugal relationship and what are the generally acceptable characteristics of a conjugal relationship. This is from Justice Cory in M. v H. They include shared shelter, sexual and personal behaviour, services, social activities, economic support and children, as well as the societal perception of the couple. However, these elements may be present in varying degrees and not all are necessary for the relationship to be found to be conjugal.\n\nThe court said:\n\nCertainly an opposite sex couple may, after many years together, be considered to be in a conjugal relationship although they have neither children nor sexual relations. Obviously the weight to be accorded the various elements or factors to be considered in determining whether an opposite sex couple is in a conjugal relationship will vary widely and almost infinitely. The same must hold true of same sex couples. Courts have wisely determined that the approach to determining whether a relationship is conjugal must be flexible....There is nothing to suggest that same sex couples do not meet the legal definition of conjugal.\n\nThat is what the courts have ruled. Frankly it is disingenuous of the member for Calgary Centre to suddenly raise these concerns about how we can establish the legitimacy of conjugal relationships and common law relationships when Reform did not ask one question when it was just about common law heterosexual relationships.\n\nThey were not asking at that point how to prove they had a sexual relationship or how to prove they were really living together in an intimate relationship. They did not care about that then. They certainly did not raise questions then about other dependent relationships when they extended this to common law relationships.\n\nWhat Reformers really care about is that we are actually recognizing that the relationships of gay and lesbian people should be treated with equality, dignity and respect. That is what Reformers do not believe in because not one of them voted for equality even in the Canadian Human Rights Act.",

Unbelievably some courts have recognized the gay panic defence, which suggests that if a man is so traumatized by having a sexual advance made on him by another man that he takes that other person's life it is defensible. The member for Yukon is quite correct that significant challenges remain with respect to a defence of this nature.\n\nWith respect to the ongoing issue of violence and gay-bashing in our community, there are people who are beaten up simply because of their sexual orientation or perceived sexual orientation. There are huge concerns about gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgendered youth who still have levels of suicide, attempted suicide and alienation that are devastatingly high.\n\nThese are some of the other issues that we clearly must address. This bill is not in a position to address them, but when we speak of full equality we must recognize there is still a lot of work to be done in many of these areas and the whole area of affirmation of our relationships, the diversity of our communities and the education system.\n\nLet us imagine children who are raised in an environment with a parent who has the kind of narrow intolerant views of some of the members on my right, those from the Reform Party. What kind of attitude or signal will that send to them about respect for gay and lesbian people in our communities?\n\nThere is still tremendous work to be done on the road to full equality.",

            "text": "Madam Speaker, I am very pleased to speak to this piece of very important and timely legislation, one that has obviously raised emotions on all sides of this debate. I congratulate the previous speaker and in fact all speakers who have represented their parties and their country well in this debate.\n\nIt is unfortunate in terms of the debate and the time that the legislation was introduced that we are once again put in the position as opposition to rush to judgment on the legislation, to hurry along in our remarks, and to somehow push this issue to one side.\n\nFrom the tone, the emotion and the very important considerations that are brought forward by the bill and the very important debates that will no doubt take place in our communities, this is not a healthy approach. This is not the way that we should be dealing with issues of such depth.\n\nThe bill was tabled in the House on Friday, February 11. We have had the ensuing weekend, and here we are on Tuesday, forced in essence to dissect and discuss in detail hundreds of detailed pages which affect 68 federal statutes that will be amended. There are also the provincial implications and voluminous case law very much encompassed by the legislation.\n\nI for one, as a member of the Progressive Conservative Party, do take great exception to and in fact resent the way in which the government has gone about tabling this issue. I also question the timeliness in terms of its proximity to what is perhaps one of the biggest scandals in the country's history.\n\nThere is an obvious attempt to deflect attention away from that, to somehow create an illusion that another issue will come on the agenda and perhaps bury the issue of the mismanagement that has taken place in Human Resources Development Canada, mismanagement that is perhaps systemic in many government departments.\n\nThis omnibus legislation will extend benefits and obligations to same sex couples on the same basis as opposite sex couples under the current laws of the land. The bill is entitled the modernization of benefits and obligations. There is an important inclusion of the word obligations in this act.\n\nIt is something we cannot gloss over. We cannot forget that with the entitlement aspects of the bill there are also obligations that will flow. In some instances, when we are talking about the tax implications, there are what could be viewed as or deemed negative consequences for homosexual individuals who will now be in a position where they will be paying a greater tax. They will in fact be disentitled by virtue of being deemed as in what is tantamount to a common law situation. That element is there.\n\nThe modernization as well is an encapsulation, a title which does represent something that is happening, a social change. It is an acknowledgement in the legislation that there has been a step toward recognizing the social reality that we have same sex couples living in common law situations or what is equivalent to a common law situation, as we speak. Regardless of what the legislation says or seeks to do, this is a social reality that the bill very much attempts to recognize.\n\nThe government's reasoning behind the legislation is very much a result of a decision by the Supreme Court of Canada in May 1999. I am speaking about the M. v H. case, which made it very clear that governments cannot limit benefits or obligations by discriminating against same sex common law relationships. The legislation is very much an attempt to reflect and codify what the supreme court already said in May of this year.\n\nIt goes without saying that previous cases have also moved in this direction in supreme courts across the country. In various provinces there has been a recognition of the obligations and a codification of the fact that there are rights and obligations that stem from a relationship between same sex couples.\n\nIt is also very important to point out, and it bears repeating, that the principles of equality enshrined in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and the Canadian Human Rights Act are very much a part of this debate, very much a part of the consideration by all courts, most important the Supreme Court of Canada, and I suspect very much at the foundation of what is behind the legislation, an attempt to legislate and put in place the protections that exist in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.\n\nThe government is no stranger to borrowing from the supreme court. We have seen what it has tried to do with the clarity bill. The court has already made a pronouncement in its decision about the status of the situation in Quebec. It refers specifically to the percentage of a majority and the question itself. The government has tried to encapsulate that through Cartesian thinking in legislation that again has been foisted upon parliament and the country at a time when we should be discussing other issues.\n\nThat is not to diminish in any way the importance of this type of legislation. If this were a priority, if we take the government at its word and this were truly a priority, why did it not introduce the legislation much sooner in its mandate? Why did it not introduce it back in the fall session when we resumed after the lengthy summer recess the government orchestrated with the late recall? What legislation were we faced with when we returned? It was not legislation that I would suggest reflected the importance of the particular bill. Here we are being forced to deal very quickly with very important legislation in a matter of days.\n\nThe bill, as indicated, will affect a great number of statutes, some 68 in total, legislation such as the Criminal Code of Canada and the Income Tax Act. It will have many financial implications for all. The government sat on the legislation for many months and dropped it in our laps at a time when it needed an issue that would deflect attention away from it.\n\nThe legislation needs a great deal of examination. It needs a great deal of study which will occur at the justice committee. Unfortunately the justice committee is backlogged at this point with legislation such as the new youth criminal justice act. We have a mandate from this place to deal with organized crime. We have a mandate to deal with changes to the Corrections and Conditional Release Act. However, this legislation is coming and will go to that committee. There will be an opportunity to dissect the legislation in greater detail, which obviously will not occur on the floor of the House.\n\nThis is what I would describe as a very technical bill. I know there is a tendency to delve into the moral issues and moral implications that arise from this discussion, but the bill is written in a very calculating way—and I do not say that in a negative way—to reflect a reality on which the courts have pronounced, toward which society has moved, and toward which the provinces are heading.\n\nI give the government credit in the sense that for a change it is trying to be out in front of what the courts are pronouncing. For a change we are seeing an actual proactive attempt to reflect Canadian reality in this place as legislators rather than wait for judge made law to be imposed upon us or foisted upon elected individuals.\n\nThe provinces that have already moved in this direction include British Columbia, Quebec and Ontario. They have very much attempted to implement their own legislation, with which this legislation is consistent.\n\nI strongly suggest there have been indications in the private sector that this is reflective of a reality that has occurred. Many companies in the private sector have extended the type of benefits the legislation would also extend. In fact many institutions in the country including churches have accepted and looked at some of the realities the bill will put in place.\n\nPublic policy, therefore, is not a sideline issue. It is not the sole purpose or the actual intent of the legislation. The subject of the bill or the reading of it is not about families. It is not about families per se and definitions. It does not speak of the definition of marriage. It does not use the term spouse. It is about fairness and financial equality. It is not about infringing on an individual's moral or personal beliefs.\n\nIf there is anything we can learn from this debate that we are undertaking today, it is that we should be very careful in our choice of words. I am very fearful of the rhetoric and the ratcheting up of the rhetoric that can occur because of the emotion and the strong moral beliefs that are felt and held on both sides. If anything, we have to be respectful of both sides of this debate. This is an issue that has been with us for time immemorial. This is not an issue that will be settled by this debate or by the passing of one piece of legislation.\n\nConjugal relations certainly denote an element of intimacy. However, this legislation is not, I would suggest, about governments making judgments or being intrusive into the bedrooms of the nation. This is about reflecting responsibilities and obligations upon individuals who have entered into a relationship upon which there is a degree of dependency. The bill is about the fiscal responsibility of the state in recognizing this human dynamic, this relationship that exists between both same sex and opposite sex partners.\n\nThere has already been, as some would call it, a disintegration of the institution of marriage in the sense that the law now recognizes common law. The legislation, in my view, takes it one step further. It expands the definition of common law to include same sex partners, that is all. It recognizes a reality that is very much in place in this country. There are same sex couples living together in a relationship that is akin to the relationship that occurs between opposite sex couples. This is a legal codification or recognition of the rights and obligations that flow from that human dynamic.\n\nThe bounds of matrimonial relations obviously have legal implications in and of themselves. This is not an infringement on those legal obligations. This is more about property, money and pensions. This is about the ability of the state to support individuals who may be in need or entitled to a pension plan for which they have contributed.\n\nThe legislation also requires that the same obligations, in terms of the contribution and the eligibility, be met, whether it be by a same sex or opposite sex couple.\n\nThere is an element of logic that has to prevail here. I know it is very difficult at times to move the debate from the moral and personal element of this. However, there is a very sterile and reasoned approach that we have to take when examining the issue of legal responsibility and the responsibility of the state to care for people.\n\nThe bill does not undermine the morality and the traditional beliefs that individuals have in their definition of family. Let us be very honest and blunt about this; what has been viewed for many centuries as the traditional family is now different for many people. It is different in their views. The family support system has become very different. I need not go further than to mention the example of a single parent, whether they be male or female. That should in no way diminish the degree of dependence and unconditional love that might flow between a parent and a child just because he or she happens to be a single parent.\n\nEconomic issues can never be completely devoid of moral implications, but let us not confuse the two. Let us not make a mistake in our characterization of the legislation. This is about extending financial benefits to those who may be in need.\n\nThe legislation has only been in our hands for two working days. I again question the priorities and the timing of the government. The Conservative Party members are looking forward to the opportunity to delve into the legislation at the committee level, to hear from witnesses and to see what the broad reaching implications may in fact be.\n\nMy initial reading of the legislation is as I indicated at the outset. It is an attempt to codify and put in place a reality that exists, a legal trend through precedent and through case law that has emerged from our courts. I would suggest that this legislation still maintains a clear and distinct designation between married and unmarried relationships. It does not tread on that sacred ground.\n\nThe term “spouse” refers and will refer, irrespective of this legislation, to married couples. That term has not been touched, altered or removed from mainstream thought as a result of the bill.\n\nThe term “common law partner” does change. It would now be expanded to include both same sex and opposite sex couples. This is different. This is perhaps the major differentiation between the bill and the Ontario legislation in the sense that Ontario designates same sex and opposite sex partners in its legislation. It makes that clear line of distinction.\n\nThere will be ample opportunity for all members of the committee and, by virtue of their membership, members of their parties and Canadians whom they represent to make amendments and suggestions as to how the bill might be improved. Some of the improvements may be to remove certain clauses of the bill.\n\nHowever, it does speak again to both benefits and obligations and the responsibilities that flow therefrom. Same sex couples will have access, by virtue of this type of legislation, to the same level of support, the same pension and the same financial benefits that other Canadian couples of the opposite sex currently have based on social benefits. The important underlying element is, if they are eligible and if they have made sufficient contributions, they will still have to meet that criteria.\n\nThe legislation is consistent with what the provinces have been looking at. I believe that many provinces will wait to see how this place and the other place deals with the bill. They are hinging their future plans to encompass this type of legislation in the provinces on what we do.\n\nLet us make no mistake. The federal legislation will have an impact on much of what the provinces do already. It will have an impact on things such as adoption and family maintenance. This is why I think it is important for us to realize that the bill does have very far-reaching ramifications that we should not take lightly. We should not be diverted from looking at the bill in detail as to what it actually does and does not do.\n\nI know there has been a great deal of discussion by some. I would suggest, with the greatest of respect, that there is some veiled attempt to perhaps hide what may be a negative view of the legislation by suggesting that the bill is not broad enough, that it somehow does not include a parental relationship, such as a mother and daughter, a father and son, two sisters or two aunts who may live together. There is obviously a mechanism to deal with that situation and that is again in the committee.\n\nI am led to believe that there will be ample opportunity to look at the possibility of expanding the legislation if that is what some members and some witnesses choose to do. Let us not hide behind the rhetoric. Let us not somehow put forward the position that we wish to make it broader when truly the attempt and the intent is to make it narrower and to undermine and take the bill off the agenda.\n\nI realize that what we are looking at is a bill that has the financial element to it: tax breaks on retirement savings plans, greater access to employment insurance, collector survivor benefits under the Canada pension plan upon the death of a partner, old age security. This is the element of the bill on which we should be focusing.\n\nHomosexual couples who have lived together for at least one year would qualify for those types of benefits, with the same time, the same qualifications and the same elements of accountability that are currently applied to common law couples. The cost is something that has been touched upon. Sources in government indicate that there will be an initial cost associated with this. However, this will be offset by the responsibilities and obligations that are created and the offsetting disentitlement that will be created by this designation of same sex couples.\n\nWe in the Conservative Party will reserve our final judgment. We will reserve our position until we have an opportunity to look at this bill in greater detail at committee. I believe this is very forward looking legislation but it is legislation that can be improved. We must go forward with a view to improving this in a reasoned, moderate and tolerant approach.",

I have a great deal of respect for the work that he does both on the justice committee and here in the House.

They steer clear of the words that would invoke the emotion and the judgment of members and Canadians generally when it comes to defining what marriage really means. There are obviously religious and spiritual connotations. As the member has pointed out, there is a long history that transcends boundaries and cultures when it comes to marriage.\n\nI think this legislation attempts to remove some of the emotional elements and focuses in on other very fundamental elements such as equality, justice and humanity. I believe this is very much the direction in which we should be moving. If we try to mix the two, the purpose of the bill can, unfortunately, be clouded and the objectives of the bill may be lost. I think we should stay away from what is strictly defined as a spouse and trying to define what a family is using words like tradition.

If the traditional view of a family were that there would have to be two parents living in a household to be considered a family, my personal view is, that would be wrong.\n\nWe have the common law recognition of two people who profoundly care for one another and want to share their lives together exclusive of others. It takes away the element of the ceremony and perhaps the religious or spiritual practices that are involved in the ceremony of marriage, but it does not remove the human elements of caring and sharing, living together and mutual respect.\n\nI am not trying to avoid the question. Do I think there is value in recognizing what is a family? Yes. Do I think there is value in defining family in rigid, exclusive and exclusionary terms? No, I do not. That may be a debate for another time. If this is about giving individuals the ability to have financial freedom and financial entitlement in a broader, more open way, perhaps that is where we should be going.\n\nI reserve the right to look at this legislation in greater detail at the committee.

As the member knows, when we present petitions on behalf of our constituents, we are instruments of their voices. We are bringing to parliament a certain view.\n\nDo I ascribe to the view that the definition of marriage is between a man and a woman, and that particular institution, with all that flows from it? Yes, I do. If an individual wants to have that definition placed to one side, recognizing that there are other definitions such as common law and the expanded view of common law that this legislation would bring about, I see no problem with that, as long as it is not exclusionary and as long as it is not used in an intolerant way to say that because we are married we are somehow entitled to something that another is not on a financial basis.\n\nWhat happens between a couple in what is deemed to be a marriage, I have no difficulty in saying that I personally ascribe to the view that that involves a man and a woman.\n\nShould there be another definition? The Reform Party member's colleague from Edmonton has brought forward a very interesting suggestion that we should have something called registered domestic partnerships, which would create another definition, separate from this view of what is marriage. Perhaps that is something we should look at as well.\n\nThe member across has indicated that this is a debate which has been around for centuries. We are not going to cure it in 48 hours, but at least at the committee we will have an opportunity to look at some of the options and try to achieve the largest umbrella that will help the largest number of people, which is, at the end of the day, what we all should strive for.",

            "text": "Madam Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the member for Scarborough East.\n\nI am delighted to have this opportunity to speak in favour of Bill C-23, the modernization of benefits and obligations act. I begin by commending the Minister of Justice, the Minister of Finance, the President of the Treasury Board, the Minister of Human Resources Development and the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration for their joint efforts, co-operation and collaboration in enabling the government to table this omnibus legislation.\n\nThe purpose of this legislation is straightforward. The bill will amend legislation to recognize the principle of equal treatment for all common law relationships. Same sex partners will be included in the new definition of common law partners. They will be granted the same benefits and obligations as opposite sex common law partners. Same sex spouses who have lived together for at least one year will qualify for benefits, the same length of time as common law spouses.\n\nBill C-23 will amend 68 federal statutes, affecting 20 federal departments and agencies. The legislation affected covers a wide range of subject matter, from the Bank Act to the Canadian Wheat Board Act, to the criminal code and the Firearms Act, the Indian Act, the Public Service Employment Act, the Trade Unions Act and the War Veterans Allowances Act, just to name a few statutes.\n\nThe proposed changes are about fairness. The changes are not about granting special rights; they are about equality before the law. The changes are about fairness, tolerance and non-discrimination. These changes are a reminder to us all that it is not acceptable to discriminate against any person at any time or at any place.\n\nThe proposed changes will ensure that our laws reflect the values of Canadians, and Canadian values, values that are enshrined in our Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.\n\nWhen we speak about the values of Canadians it is not surprising to find that the majority of Canadians believe, as I do, that same sex couples should receive equal treatment. According to an Angus Reid poll taken in September 1999, 67% of Canadians agreed that same sex couples should have the same legal rights and obligations as a man and woman living together as common law partners. Regional support was broken down as follows: in my province of Ontario, 66% of Canadians were in support; in B.C. support was at 68%; and in Atlantic Canada support was at a high of 75%.\n\nWhile I would like to applaud the federal government for taking bold leadership on this issue, unfortunately I cannot do so. On the day the bill was introduced in the House of Commons the Minister of Justice stated: “Canadians are probably way ahead of legislators on this issue”.\n\nThese changes come almost a year after a Supreme Court of Canada decision ruled that same sex common law couples are entitled to the same benefits under family law as heterosexual couples. On Friday the Minister of Justice confirmed that the court gave the government the direction in which it needed to go.\n\nBoth federally and provincially there have been many challenges before courts and human rights tribunals regarding the benefits of same sex couples. In its May 1999 ruling in M. v H. the Supreme Court of Canada made it clear that government cannot limit benefits or obligations by discriminating against same sex common law relationships. Denying equal treatment before the law to same sex common law partners is contrary to the principles of equality enshrined in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms as well as the Canadian Human Rights Act.\n\nSeveral provinces have already begun to amend their legislation. Since 1997 B.C. has amended numerous statutes, including six core statutes, to add same sex couples. In June 1999 Quebec amended 28 statutes and 11 regulations to grant same sex couples the same benefits and obligations that are available to opposite sex common law spouses. In October 1999 in Ontario, to comply with the supreme court decision in M. v H., the Harris government passed omnibus legislation to bring 67 statutes into compliance with the ruling.\n\nHowever, this is not the first time the federal government has passed legislation to extend benefits to same sex partners. In fact parliament passed Bill C-78, which extended survivor's pension benefits to same sex partners of federal public service employees. All three territories and a number of other provinces have also passed similar legislation. These provinces include Manitoba, Quebec, Saskatchewan, British Columbia, Ontario, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia.\n\nIt should also be noted that Bill C-23 will not have an impact on the private sector. However, it is equally worthy to note that over 200 private sector employers have already extended work related benefits, such as dental care and pension benefits, to same sex partners for their employees, as do most municipalities, hospitals, libraries and community and social service institutions across Canada.\n\nIt is incumbent upon the federal government to act now. While some of the provinces have amended their statutes, Canadians must remember that under the Constitution Act, 1867 legislative jurisdiction is divided between the Parliament of Canada and the provincial legislatures. For example, Ontario amended 67 provincial laws that were the exclusive responsibility of the province, most notably the Family Law Act. This omnibus bill tabled by the government will amend only federal statutes.\n\nLet me give some specific examples. Under the Income Tax Act a married person or a common law opposite sex partner may claim a tax credit for a dependent spouse or partner. The changes would provide that a same sex partner may also now claim the tax credit for a dependent partner.\n\nUnder the Old Age Security Act a married person or a common law opposite sex partner may claim an income supplement depending on the combined income of both partners. The changes that were tabled today would provide an income supplement claim for a same sex partner, but it would also be based on combined income.\n\nWe can see from the two examples I have used that the bill strikes a balance by extending both benefits and obligations to committed same sex couples.\n\nI would like to give another example to illustrate the point I have just made about this balance. A household's income is one of the criteria used to determine a common law couple's eligibility for the GST or the HST tax credit. Because our laws do not presently recognize committed same sex relationships, individuals in such relationships can claim eligibility for these tax credits based on their personal income. Under the proposed legislation their eligibility would be calculated based on combined income, representing, in total, some savings for the government. On the other hand, we estimate that awarding survivor's benefits to surviving partners of committed same sex partners will represent a modest cost to the CPP. However, overall we estimate that the fiscal impact of these amendments will be minimal, if at all.\n\nRecent court rulings have confirmed for legislatures the need to address the constitutionality of certain laws that discriminate against same sex couples.\n\nAs parliamentarians it is our responsibility to amend these statutes to ensure they conform with the charter. In the absence of legislative action the courts will continue to address cases in a piecemeal fashion. The status quo is not an option. It promises confusion, unfairness, and continuing and costly litigation. Equally important, it risks making the courts the arbiters of social policy.\n\nOur proposed bill affirms parliament's primary responsibility for social policy. It provides a responsible, balanced and legally sound framework within which to address recent court decisions and, most importantly, to ensure that same sex couples receive fair and equal treatment under the law.",

            "text": "Madam Speaker, I find myself in somewhat of an unusual position, being opposed to this bill while being on the government side.\n\nThe bill is fairly simple. It really could be written in one line: common law heterosexual relationships are the legal equivalent to common law homosexual relationships. Therein lies the entire issue.\n\nRegardless of what any of us think, the face of the Canadian family is changing. It is really quite revolutionary. In the course of my lifetime the divorce rate, for instance, has gone quite high. Something in the order 40% to 45% of marriages fail over the course of the lifetime of a marriage. I dare say that in the House the rate is even higher. The cost of marriage breakup is pretty difficult to quantify. My own view of it is that frankly the children pay the price for marriage breakup, which is a very regrettable fact in our lives.\n\nThe bill turns common law homosexual relationships into the legal equivalent of common law heterosexual relationships, which for many purposes is equivalent to marriage. However no one seems to get into the issue of equivalency and whether it should be treated as such. To say that marriages break up over the course of a lifetime at a rate of about 40% or 45% is and of itself a regrettable statistic, but common law relationships break up something in the order of 60% to 65% over the course of five years. From what I understand, gay and lesbian relationships break up at the rate of about 90% over the course of one year.\n\nFor public policy purposes one has to question whether they should be treated as equivalencies in law. Statistically the relationships are clearly not equivalent. My view for public policy purposes is that they should not be treated as the same before all purposes of public policy. However the bill does precisely that. I will not argue the point that common law relationships, be they homosexual or heterosexual, are not as committed, as loving or as whatever as any other relationship, but I do not think that frankly is the point.\n\nWe should not be basing public policies on some dubious notions, shall we say, of commitment and care for each other. Rather we should be basing public policy on the basis of the encouragement of what works and the treatment of other relationships as not offensive to equality.\n\nI do not think there is anyone in this debate who argues with the basic point of equality and treating relationships in so far as possible on a basis of equality, but it seems that the government of the day, regardless of political stripe, needs to encourage the relationships that form the bedrock of our society.\n\nThe arguments that support the passage of the bill are as follows. The first argument is that the courts made us do it. That is what I call the bunker Mike Harris argument. Mike Harris thought that the best way to deal with a difficult political policy issue was to empty the legislature and have first, second and third readings all on the same day. Then he simply hoped that the fallout would be minimal.\n\nThis has been cited by some as a way to handle a difficult issue, and I quite agree that this is a difficult issue. It is not overly democratic, but what the heck. We get through it and get on with other things. It is called political expediency.\n\nWhat disappoints me most is the unwillingness and the inability of our government to give serious consideration to the dependency model legislation. Not only does that dependency model legislation enjoy significant support in the caucus, but in my view it would enjoy significant support in the House. It was a great opportunity, to turn a phrase of Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau, to get the nation out of the bedrooms of the nation and to remodel public policy based upon need or dependency rather than upon one's sex life.\n\nBy choosing this route the government has exacerbated the divisions both within caucus and within the House rather than leading members to points of reconciliation and harmonization of views. The government has bought into the bunker Mike Harris mentality without every having read the cases.\n\nAny fair minded reading of the lead case in the area of M. v H. shows that the courts are more than willing to defer to parliament. In fact, they have given four and a half or almost five years for parliament to debate the issue and deal with it. Now we are told that we will have about two weeks in which to put the legislation through the House.\n\nThe management or control of this issue is well on its way to achieving that which it tried to studiously avoid. I believe the House could have come together on a dependency model and that parliamentarians could have articulated the views to and for Canadians, but instead in the haste to control government has made the issue divisive. I am perfectly prepared to concede that the issue is complex and fraught with difficulties, but the bill in my view is the refuge of the intellectually bankrupt and is the least that can be done under the circumstances.\n\nThis is not leadership in the field. It is frankly leadership by doing the minimum. Canadians have every right to wonder why together, whatever one's sexual persuasion, is the legal equivalent of marriage. For those of us who hold a high view of marriage, this is an amendment that is irksome and may well be damaging to the overall health of society. One year is frankly just like getting socks and underwear in the drawer. To make it the legal equivalent of marriage is something that needs to be thought about.\n\nThe government recognizes that having socks and underwear in a drawer is the legal equivalent of marriage and in fact prefers that relationship over the commitment by a son or a daughter to look after an infirm or disabled parent or child. When we put it in that phrasing we realize that we are going down a path of public policy which many Canadians may well not wish to go down.\n\nThere is something not quite right here. The bill will not enjoy my support. One of the sales points of the bill is that the government would leave the definition of marriage alone. Instead of articulating the definition of marriage in the bill the government has chosen to say nothing.\n\nOf course one day after the passage of the bill there is nothing to stop a justice of any court saying that in his or her view the definition of marriage is old, antiquated, out of date and should be modernized. Then once again we will be going through this dance of the dialectic in the courts. We will be complaining about judicial activism and that parliamentarians will not have any say in the issue. Instead of dealing with the issue at this opportune moment, we are not dealing with the issue at this opportune moment.\n\nOnce again Canadians will not have their say in what they believe to be the essence of marriage and all the resolutions passed in the House will not matter at all, which is quite regrettable. A court will once again decide social policy, which is probably one of the last places one should deal with social policy. Then the justice minister of the day will introduce a bill amending the Marriage Act, arguing that he or she had really no choice but to follow the wishes of the court.\n\nThis is not a criticism of judicial activism. Rather it is a criticism of parliamentary inactivism. Canadians do not have a say through their elected representatives because the elected representatives do not insist on having their say.\n\nThere is a multitude of good reasons to oppose the bill, but the most significant one is that the government could have done so much more and has chosen to do so little. It did not define marriage and it could have. It could have got out of the bedrooms of the nation and it did not. It could have adopted a dependency model legislation and it did not. It could have reflected the changing face of Canadian families in our society.",

It is a mini United Nations that is a model for other schools, one that not only teaches racial harmony, tolerance and respect but lives it throughout the school. It is a dynamic progressive school that is offering unique challenges to thousands of young adults while participating with major companies like Apotex Pharmaceuticals in a new program called Cyberspace.\n\nThis unfortunate incident could have happened anywhere in the city of Toronto or elsewhere in our country. Incidents involving violence, our young people and our communities continue to increase and they demand a multifaceted approach to looking for solutions.

Contrary to an all too common notion, it is fragile because it is based on a tacit agreement between parliamentarians and citizens that the most diverse points of view should be heard.\n\nIn that respect, our political system leaves a lot of room to the executive branch, which controls the legislative branch and which appoints the judges who administer justice. This is what gives particular importance to our parliamentary committees. These committees are the one forum where partisanship can and must be avoided.\n\nYesterday the committee examining Bill C-20 ignored this tacit agreement and gave the worst example of blind partisanship by government members.\n\nThe government decided to restrict the freedom of the committee in order to ram Bill C-20 through the House.

            "text": "Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to participate in the debate on Bill C-23, same sex benefits, better known as the bedroom bill because if nothing is happening in the bedroom one does not qualify.\n\nThe Right Honourable Pierre Elliott Trudeau, the former Liberal Prime Minister of Canada, said in 1967 that “The state has no business in the bedrooms of the nation”. Unfortunately, the Minister of Justice and her government have decided that it was really necessary to introduce a bill whose purpose goes against that historic statement.\n\nWhen the minister introduced the bill on Friday she kept repeating terms like tolerance, inclusion and acceptance. It is too bad the minister and the government do not practise what they preach. The bill is an inappropriate intrusion and in fact is discriminatory. It extends benefits based on sexual activity and excludes all other types of dependency relationships.\n\nThis is particularly disturbing at a time when more and more dependency relationships that do not include sexual activity are growing. Here we have the Minister of Justice, representing a party whose mantra was the government has no business in the bedrooms of the nation, introducing a bill that makes private sexual activity the sole criterion for eligibility and benefits.\n\nHow times change. We have the government that preaches democracy and inclusion excluding thousands of individuals who are in dependency relationships, thanks to the economic situation caused by this uncaring government.\n\nThe bill has one spin and it is based solely on conjugal relationships. It is unfair. Seventy-one per cent of Canadians feel that benefits and obligations should not depend on relationships like spouse but on any relationships of dependency where people are living together.\n\nI will repeat that for my colleague over there from Vancouver city. Seventy-one per cent of Canadians feel that benefits and obligations should not depend on relationships like spouse but on any relationship of dependency where people are living together, such as elderly siblings living together or a parent and an adult child living together.\n\nClearly the government is out of step on this issue by basing benefits on private sexual intimacies rather than on cases of dependency. The Liberals will have to hire sex police to apply the legislation, and will that not be interesting? They may laugh at that right now but we will have sex police, mark my words, before this bill is finished.\n\nI can see a lot of litigation surrounding the bill and, more important for all those Liberal friends over there, a lot of new legal practices in Canada. The government seems to do a lot of drafting of bills and setting things up so that lawyers have more work to do. That is wrong. The bill should not be about lawyers. It should be about people living together and depending on each other. Sex should not be involved in the bill.\n\nOn June 8, 1999, parliament passed a motion with 216 in favour and 55 against. The motion called on parliament to take all necessary steps to preserve the definition of marriage as the union of one man and one woman to the exclusion of all others. I was very proud like many of those other hundreds of people here to vote in favour of that bill. One would have thought this bill would have presented the government with an opportunity to enshrine this motion, but not a word.\n\nIt seems the Liberals have a problem with the institution of marriage. Simple recognition of this institution would have gone a long way in fostering support for Bill C-23. The bill gives out marriage-like benefits by failing to define marriage. What is the problem with the government? Is it afraid to define marriage?\n\nLet us be honest. We all know why we have the bill before us today. I feel sorry for the legislative drafters at justice. They must have burned a lot of midnight oil over the last week or so in putting the bill together. Imagine the rush they were put to. All this was in an attempt to deflect attention away from the debacle at human resources.\n\nHow obvious can one get in one's attempt to salvage the squandering of one billion dollars? I would have thought the spin doctors in the PMO would have come up with something more novel and creative than this. It is an insult to think that one can detract attention away from an issue that has shaken the faith of Canadians in the system, but this government always tries that.\n\nThe finance department estimates that 1.6% of couples are gay which would indicate some 140,000 homosexual couples. In preparing this rush job to save its political skin, did the government consult, contact or discuss the situation for others who were in dependency relationships but who were not engaging in sexual activity? In a bill like this one would we not think that would be important? When we are taking a major step, how much time did we take to talk to people who were not engaged in sexual activity? It looks like very little if none.\n\nCanadians have a right to ask why we are moving forward a step at a time. Why are we moving one step? Which couple will be the first to go to the supreme court and say “We do not have sex but we think we also have rights?” That couple will go to the supreme court and win, and we will be back here drafting more legislation. Why do we not get it right the first time? Let us get it right before we proceed.\n\nDid the government for a moment give that element any thought? The Minister of Justice is a master at consulting for years and years on other issues. On the Young Offenders Act it was years and years. On drunk driving it was years and years. On consecutive sentencing it was years and years. I could go on and on. The minister is an expert at consulting and getting no bills through the House.\n\nWhat makes this issue any different? The minister got orders from her political masters, the supreme court. If the Liberals had it their way, all legislation would be drafted by the court.\n\nThe government loves this judicial activism. If the court says so, we must comply. On the other hand the court has used and abused the charter for its own purposes and with the inertia of the government it is the court making the laws.\n\nWith the introduction of the charter to the Canadian constitution, a great departure began from the historic division of responsibilities between parliament and the courts. The consequences of this departure include the replacement of the supremacy of parliament with the supremacy of the constitution as interpreted by judges. Power has been transferred from parliament and legislatures to the courts.\n\nFurthermore, this charter has thrust unelected judges with no direct accountability to the people into the realm of decision making and political activism. I do not think Canadians ever wanted their judges to be involved in political activism. That is what is happening in this country because of the Liberal government and the Tory government before it.\n\nThe consequences of this new but improper alignment of the roles of parliament, the administration and the courts have been far reaching and dangerous. Frankly it is time to re-establish several hundred years of constitutional convention whose premise is that parliament makes the laws, the administration administers the laws, and the courts are there to interpret the laws.\n\nWe have seen the Prime Minister get up in the House many times when we have talked about the Senate. He has said that we have done things traditionally for a long time and that it was good for this country. He has changed in these areas; he should also change on the Senate.\n\nAny delegation of law making by the executive to the courts by default, which is what the government does, or any proactive assumption of law making by the courts is a violation of the basic constitutional principle. It needs to be corrected.\n\nThe government has given tacit approval to this misalignment of responsibilities by its vagueness in drafting laws and passing the buck to a supreme court only too eager to employ the charter in each and every instance. We have to get away from that.\n\nThis parliament has to draft laws that do not need big interpretations and then come back to parliament. We should be doing our job in the House and we should not have to blame any judges. But we are not doing the job in the House. The minister admitted that this morning by saying that this law is not perfect and that we have to look after all these other people. Where is it? It is not in this bill. What is the rush? Let us get it right before we proceed.\n\nBy its vagueness in drafting laws and passing the buck to the supreme court, which I mentioned is only too eager to apply the charter in each and every instance, the government provides every opportunity to the court to flex its charter muscle. The government plays cat and mouse with the court, particularly on sensitive national issues and thus encourages and nurtures the role of the court as a law maker rather than an interpreter of the laws. The Reform Party would put an end to this charter madness and judicial activism by way of a three part program.\n\nFirst, an all party judicial parliamentary committee should be struck to review the fitness of all supreme court nominees. It is time the people had some say, not just the leader of the government. We have a three part plan which makes some sense.\n\nSecond, all legislation should be reviewed for its charter compatibility before it becomes law. My colleagues on the Liberal side seem not to understand this. They are not doing their jobs on that side. They are producing laws that are being shot back to us from the supreme court all of the time. They should be ashamed of themselves for making laws that keep on coming back here from the supreme court.",

            "text": "Madam Speaker, they ask how many sides I have sat on. I have been on one side, the right side, not the left side. I know it really upsets them when we have good ideas. The people sitting on the backbench on that side are not allowed to have any ideas. They have to rubber stamp what comes from the front row.\n\nIt was very nice to see my Liberal friend from Scarborough East get up this morning and say that this bill was not a good bill and he could not vote for it. I hope a few others on that side do the same.\n\nFinally, all supreme court decisions should be reviewed to see if they gibe with the intent of the laws passed by this parliament.\n\nI spoke earlier about the rush to get this legislation to parliament. One has to really wonder about the Liberals' sense of priority and condemn their manipulation of the events that take place.\n\nHere we have a country which has been in limbo for over a year on the issue of child pornography. Despite the minister promising to act swiftly and decisively on the issue, we will wait around probably for another six months or more before we have a decision. Where is the justice minister on that issue?\n\nThe minister and the government refused all attempts by the opposition to have the notwithstanding clause invoked to reinstate the possession of child pornography as an offence. Sixty-four government members wanted to use that too but they voted against it when the Prime Minister said so. They saw no urgency in protecting our children from pedophiles who perpetrate this perverted behaviour. They ignored a petition with 500,000 signatures calling for reinstatement of the law.\n\nIt is amazing how the Liberals jump to attention for other groups. What is more of a priority, same sex benefits or protecting innocent young children? We will see how quickly the minister acts on this issue if the law is struck down by the supreme court. Will it be a priority then? That will be a big issue in the House.\n\nOther criminal justice issues cry out for attention. Surely the conditional sentencing mess requires attention. Surely the issue of drugs in prisons and the proliferation of drug use and its terrible social consequences are very much priority issues.\n\nIt took the minister three years before we got her to act on young offenders. It took her three years on young offenders. She can sure study things to death.\n\nLast summer we finally got around to the issue of impaired driving. How many years did that take? We await the finalization of this initiative. It is on the Order Paper, but obviously same sex benefits is more of a priority.\n\nThe minister made a big issue about her animal abuse bill last December. It was so important. Where is it now? It got the PR, it got the flack, but where is it now? Same sex legislation took over from that. It was good politics at the time, but it currently is not so important now that certain lobby groups are appeased for the moment.\n\nThis opportunism is truly the hallmark of the Liberal government. Everything is put on a back burner so the government can play politics in its feeble attempt to deflect attention from the real issues of the day.\n\nAnother bill, proceeds of crime, languishes on the Order Paper. Of all criminal justice issues confronting this nation, the minister drops everything because the supreme court sets the agenda for her.\n\nOrganized crime has become the single greatest threat to Canada's sovereignty according to those who fight crime for a living, the policemen. They tell us that organized crime has become the biggest single threat to Canada's sovereignty. What are we doing about it? We passed the motion in the House. I have not seen the other side coming to this side and saying let us get that committee going. Let us get that before the House of Commons. No, no. The House agreed unanimously to look at organized crime. We have done nothing about it since it was passed in the House because it is not a priority of the government.\n\nThe breadth and scope of organized crime is immense. It has penetrated any area where there is an illegal dollar to be made. Would the minister consider this a priority? It certainly does not seem so.\n\nOver the weekend Toronto's new chief of police had some advice for the minister and judges on what are the priority issues in Canada. Allow me to elaborate. He said “Kids are vulnerable to sexual predators, pornographers and the dangers of a life of crime”. He went on to say that legislators and judges should get a reality check on life itself. This man is the chief of police of the largest city in Canada and knows what he is doing. I will repeat that. He said that the legislators and judges should get a reality check on life itself. Is that not a message that everybody in the House should take seriously? We have to have reality checks and we are not getting them from the other side.\n\nHe further indicated on the issue of child pornography and Robin Sharpe that Canada has been made the subject of international scorn and ridicule. To quote the police chief, he said, “I can tell you with a whole lot of shame that even third world countries are more civilized and conscientious about our duty as adults to protect the most vulnerable components of society, our children”. The chief of police said that third world countries are better than we are at protecting the vulnerabilities of our children. As I said before, where are the minister's priorities?\n\nChief Fantino cites drugs, prisons and organized crime as requiring our attention. Chief Fantino says that Canada is known as a country where crime really does pay. Canada, he says, has a reputation as a country that is soft on crime and that those who come here from elsewhere to pursue their criminal activities have little fear.\n\nIs that not scary? Those who come here from other countries to commit crimes have little fear. This is from the man who is leading the police force in the largest city in Canada. I am sure the chiefs of police of Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Regina, Saskatoon, Winnipeg and all across the country would agree with the chief of police of Toronto. He says that it is a scathing indictment on our criminal justice system. This really should give the minister pause and impetus to get down to the real issues.\n\nAccording to Fantino, south of the border Canada is seen as a sort of strainer leaking from a thousand holes. He asks if it is any wonder that even deported criminals and undesirables keep on coming back. And boy, with our immigration system we let them right back across the border as soon as they come.\n\nAlas, instead of attacking real and substantive issues, the minister plays defence for the Minister of Human Resources Development.\n\nBill C-23 is a convenient smokescreen to get the government off the hook. Instead of supporting the call for more assistance to police to fight crime, the minister chooses to send the sex police into the bedrooms of the nation. As I said earlier, a former prime minister of this country said that the government has no place in the bedrooms of anyone in this nation. Would he not be ashamed of this government bringing in legislation that gets involved in the bedrooms of the nation? I am sure he is today.\n\nThis bedroom bill, and it is a bedroom bill, will not deflect the attention away from the human resources debacle. It is shameful that the government would be so manipulative.\n\nThis morning the minister said that if parliament does not settle the issue, the courts will. What kind of leadership is that in a country? If parliament does not settle the issue, the courts will.\n\nWe have other dependent relationships and the minister said we will have to look at those. We will look at those and we will start to travel the country. Why did we not do it before we brought this bill in? Why try to be divisive in the country and leave other people outside the fence? We should be united in the country. As a parliament we should be working properly to do everything that is good for all Canadians, not just any special groups in Canada.",

In fact under the current income tax laws common law couples declare their relationships within the Income Tax Act. We are on the honour system. The representations of the taxpayers are accepted and there is no checking. It is somewhat ludicrous to suggest that somehow there is going to be any checking of such an activity.\n\nSecond, the member spent an awful lot of time talking about how the Supreme Court of Canada forced parliament to do this. I would point out that this parliament, through Bill C-33, amended the human rights act to include sexual orientation as a prohibited grounds for discrimination. The human rights commissioner of the day said that in implementing that change to the legislation there would be consequences, and these are the consequences that are appearing now. Indeed, parliament is the reason we are here today dealing with Bill C-23.\n\nI would ask the member if he would not agree that anyone in Canada who makes a declaration and who has this dependency relationship is entitled.

I would have thought he would know that the role of the civil service is to carry out those laws. I would have thought he would know that the role of the judiciary is to interpret those laws. Yet, again we hear from him, as we often do from Reform members opposite, judiciary bashing.\n\nI spent 10 years on the Waterloo regional police force and as chairman I dealt not only with police, young offenders, pornography, drunk driving and all the things he was talking about, I also interacted with the judiciary.

            "text": "Mr. Speaker, I will be splitting my time with the eloquent member for Mississauga West.\n\nWhen I rose to make my maiden speech in the House in 1994, I pointed out that my riding contains the largest gay and lesbian population in Canada. They bring a sense of diversity to our city and enrich many areas of our community, including the artistic and cultural life of our city. These citizens, fellow citizens of ours, look to the government to fulfil long unkept promises of many previous governments to ensure that discrimination in their lives and in their employment will cease so that they may play their full role in society. It is their right to live in a world with a level playing field and we owe that to them. That is what I said in my maiden speech.\n\nLater that year, on the occasion of World Human Rights Day, I said that, “As Canadians, we can be proud of our contribution to the international community on the issue of human rights and on the development of international standards to which we adhere”.\n\nThis said, we must also be ever vigilant that our human rights respect international standards and ensure the right of all Canadians to live free from discrimination in this country.\n\nA recent decision of the United Nations human rights committee ruled that sexual orientation is protected by the equality guarantees of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, a document which Canada helped prepare and which binds us.\n\nLet us, in remembering World Human Rights Day, recognize that it is our duty to ensure that our laws in this country are amended to eliminate all forms of discrimination, including any based on sexual orientation.\n\nToday the House has an opportunity to fulfil that duty and with it to achieve one of the most important tasks for which we are elected: the implementation of laws which guarantee that all our citizens may live in equality and dignity. In so doing we as Canadians know that all of society will benefit as we have so often found in this great country where our tradition of tolerance and acceptance of diversity has enabled us to create a nation which is the envy of the world.\n\nI have news for the member from West Vancouver. This is not a diversionary tactic for my constituents. This is the process of fulfilling long overdue longstanding obligations of the most fundamental kind. This is a priority for real people who are living with real problems. They merit our attention and they do not deserve to be denigrated by the words such as were used by the member who last spoke in the House.\n\nThe path to this moment has not been easy. The need to take these steps was recognized by governments long before ours, but I am proud to say our government has had the political courage to deliver on something that many had recognized was the right thing to do.\n\nI was proud to be part of the government elected in 1993 which recognized the need for these measures and implemented them. We started with Bill C-41, the sentencing act. We then passed Bill C-33 to amend the Canadian Human Rights Act. We then adopted Bill C-78 which extended pension benefits to same sex federal employees.\n\nAll of this legislation had the support of such associations as the National Association of Women and the Law, the Canadian Bar Association, the Canadian Jewish Congress, B'Nai Brith Canada, the Canadian Foundation of University Women, and the Canadian Association of Statutory Human Rights Agencies, for the very good reason that they represent basic Canadian values.\n\nFor a good number of these important institutions, these are important measures, contrary to what the Reform member who has just spoken said.\n\nThey also had the support and encouragement of our courts which in a series of charter cases such as Egan, M. and H. and Rosenberg recognized that our charter of rights and freedoms required total equal treatment for gay and lesbian couples. There is no justification in a free and democratic society, to employ the language of the charter, to discriminate against them in the manner in which our laws recognize the rights of those who live in a conjugal relationship and contribute to society together.\n\nToday this measure completes and complements the reasoning of our courts. It enables us as legislators to voice our views on this issue and to complete the work we started when we adopted the landmark changes to our human rights act, changes which foresaw and necessitated the measures being considered by the House today.\n\nI heard what was said by our colleagues opposite about this measure. They spoke about its irrelevancy, its lack of relevance and pertinence to the life that takes place in Canada today; but we already debated the appropriateness of the measures before the House when we debated the changes to the human rights act some years ago. We decided then by a free vote in the House, supported by 75% of the members voting, that the basic values of our Canadian society require that we eliminate all forms of discrimination based on sexual orientation.\n\nAt that time we knew our view was shared by the vast majority of the Canadian population, that some 70% of our fellow citizens across the country were in favour of that measure. That was then and the same 70% is in favour of these measures now for the same reasons.\n\nWhat does the legislation do? Quite simply, where there is discrimination it eliminates it. It guarantees that throughout our laws there will be equal treatment for all common law relationships in relation to benefits and obligations. As pointed out by the member from Mississauga, this is not a matter that changes anything. This is extending to common law relationships the same rules and regulations. That is the essence of the discrimination that is being eliminated.\n\nIt does not go as far as some of my constituents would have liked. For example, there are those who might have wanted to see crafted some form of matrimonial relationship for couples of the same sex; but those who would have preferred that solution know the complexity of this issue as was referred to by my colleague, the minister from Vancouver. This issue requires political co-operation between the provinces as do all matters dealing with marriage.\n\nI am sure they agree with me that what we needed to do today was to address the inequality of treatment in our statutes and to eliminate it wherever it is found. The bill accomplishes that. In so doing we have dealt with such issues as those addressed in Rosenberg. I am sorry my colleague who spoke about the courts and denigrated them earlier is not here to hear what the court in Rosenberg stated:\n\nDifferences in cohabitation and gender preferences are a reality to be equitably acknowledged, not an indulgence to be economically penalized. There is less to fear from acknowledging conjugal diversity than from tolerating exclusionary prejudice. As L'Heureux-Dubé J. said in Canada (Attorney General) v Mossop...“Given the range of human preferences and possibilities, it is not unreasonable to conclude that families may take many forms. It is important to recognize that there are differences which separate as well as commonalities which bind. The differences should not be ignored, but neither should they be used to delegitimize those families that are thought to be different”—\n\nI agree with the formulation of the court and I respect the formulation of the court. I say to members of the House that when our courts speak this way they are speaking forcefully. They are speaking with the voice of the majority of the Canadian population which accepts that we live in a society of tolerance and respect for others, and not with the voice of those who say that we should sweep away the courts which speak for no one, sweep away the Constitution of Canada, get rid of the whole idea of the charter of rights and freedoms which is one of the fundamental notions of what this country is all about, sweep it all away and we will somehow live in a world where we can apply all our discriminatory views and all our worst views of one another and impose them on ourselves and on one another.\n\nWe chose to have a charter in this country. We chose to give our courts authority to interpret our laws. I respect the decisions of those courts because I think they have fundamentally followed their requirements under the constitution. I am pleased to say that I think my constituents support the decisions of the courts too. They support this statute because it is important to gay and lesbian communities that discrimination be eliminated so they can contribute fully to society. It is important to send a signal to everyone that discrimination is not a part of our social fabric. It is also important for society in general.\n\nAs I have pointed out on numerous occasions, many institutions in Canada like universities and important companies wish to hire the best people possible. They want the Income Tax Act changed so that they are not discriminated against when they enable their finest employees to work for them in a non-discriminatory manner. This is why these measures have been adopted by many other jurisdictions, provinces and countries.\n\nI will complete my speech by saying I am proud to speak in favour of this measure. I am proud of my fellow members from all parties who support it. I am proud of our government and I am particularly proud of the many Canadians who have forced this on the House and whose indefatigable work in favour of justice and equity brought us to this historic moment in our life as a modern, diverse and equitable society.",

There needs to be a requirement of a conjugal relationship.\n\nWe have heard some pros and cons. The member is on the government side. Would he say if there were no sexual relations between two people that they would still qualify for the full suite of benefits offered under Bill C-23? Some are arguing that they would or would not.

This is not that complicated. The member knows, as does everyone who knows anything about the way in which society has evolved recently, that at one time the only way in which one got benefits under pensions or many other statutes was if one were married. We moved away from that concept to one where we recognized common law relationships. This was in the law of the provinces. It was recognized that men and women could live together in a relationship that was not blessed by holy matrimony.\n\nAll the bill does is assimilate relationships between people who are living together in similar circumstances to that of a heterosexual common law relationship and same sex couples who are living in the same relationship. That is all it does.\n\nThe whole business of sex police and everything is some sort of myth. Are there sex police going around now knocking on the doors of heterosexual couples and asking “Are you really sleeping together? You made a declaration that you are common law”.",

I never saw more acrimony and concern than when I sat in opposition in the province of Ontario when Bob Rae and the New Democrats brought in a bill. It was almost violent. The legislature was taken over by a mob. It could be described as nothing else. The majority of members of the provincial Liberal Party voted against the NDP legislation.\n\nLet me explain that I too voted against it at that time because nobody should either receive rights or lose rights based on their sexual preference. It is very important that we quote both. I could not accept the changing of the definition of marriage, which is what Bob Rae and his government put forward. The bill does not do that. That is the fundamental difference.\n\nI am going to come out of the closet and tell you, Mr. Speaker, that I am hopelessly heterosexual. My wife would tell you that the operative word is hopelessly, but I do not think that has a darn thing to do with any of this. It should not matter or enter into the debate.\n\nIn my view what we are seeing is hopeless homophobia on the part of certain members who are colouring their positions or changing them. They are totally off base and off issue. They do not want to come right out and say that they are against the bill because they are against homosexuality and gays and lesbians. In my view that is position of many of the speakers, not all to be fair, who put forward arguments on behalf of the Reform Party.\n\nWe have heard comments about the Toronto police chief making speeches to the Conservative caucus that met in Niagara Falls. Interestingly enough it was the same Conservative caucus and Conservative government in the province of Ontario that are held up as the great example of how to run a government. This is the same government, Mike Harris and his people, that passed an ominbus bill which does exactly what this bill would do. It passed it in 24 hours with no debate. It brought in what these people always cry about, closure. It brought down the hammer and adopted legislation to ensure that amendments take place that will bring justice and fairness to all Canadians.\n\nCan we ever satisfy those who are homophobic? Can we ever satisfy those who call us? I had a call the other day from someone who introduced himself to me as a reverend. I will not mention his name. He was a part time evangelical minister and I wish him well in his endeavours. He has made up his mind. He believes that only God can make this decision. He uses words like sodomy and says that the whole act of homosexuality is unnatural. He goes on and on. There is no possible way that I could ever explain any of the details in the bill to that individual.\n\nJust about every day we see someone outside this building who has that same attitude. Is there any point trying to put across the fact that there is a certain group of Canadians who are clearly being discriminated against for a reason that is irrelevant to the issues of benefits and obligations: their sexual preference. I do not care what it is.\n\nI agree that we do not need to be in the bedrooms of the nation. This idea of a sex police is just laughable. Earlier today I heard one speaker in this place say that people would take advantage, that people would claim they were living in a conjugal relationship so that they could access some form of benefit. When I thought about that I said that it was preposterous.\n\nDoes anyone here know any heterosexual male who would stand up in public or in front of his family and claim to be gay so that he could access a dental plan? Are we serious about this? Would he then go on to explain to his buddies in the hockey dressing room and to his mom and dad that he really is not gay, he just had a cavity? I use the example perhaps in the extreme, but it is such utter nonsense to think that someone would claim to be gay just to access some form of benefits. If a person is heterosexual, the last thing in the world he wants is to be accused of is being gay for any reason. It is just not reality.\n\nWhat does the bill do? The members opposite talk about what the judiciary is doing in terms of making laws. That is absolute nonsense. I heard the member for Vancouver West stand in his place and say that parliament makes the laws, the government enforces the laws and the courts interpret the laws. That is exactly right. Would we want it any other way? Would we want the courts not to have the ability to interpret the laws?\n\nWhat saves this vote for me and what makes it so fundamentally different from the one in the province of Ontario that took place under the leadership of Premier Bob Ray is the fact that the definition of marriage has not been touched.\n\nMy colleague for Scarborough East, for whom I have a lot of respect, said that it should be put in a statute. Why? Why should it not remain where it has always been? It is in common law.\n\nI want to share something that reinforces this fact. In one of her speeches, I believe on June 8, the minister said:\n\nThe Ontario court, general division recently upheld in Layland and Beaulne the definition of marriage. In that decision a majority of the court stated the following:\n\n—unions of persons of the same sex are not “marriages”, because of the definition of marriage. The applicants are, in effect, seeking to use s.15 of the Charter to bring about a change in the definition of marriage. I do not think the Charter has that effect.\n\nThe court said that this was fundamentally important for all Canadians who are concerned about the deprivation of the institution of marriage or concerned that somehow the hordes of homosexuals, as a result of getting access to justice and to benefits, were going to somehow infiltrate all of our institutions and our schools and poison our minds.\n\nWe liked that decision by the court. Maybe there are some other interpretations or decisions that we do not particularly like, but the courts are not there to please us. The courts are there to interpret the laws that are put forward by the duly elected parliamentarians. They have a responsibility that is different from ours. Because we like the one that says that this is the definition and therefore the sanctity of marriage, but we do not like another one, we get in a dither and say “We should invoke the notwithstanding clause”. The reality is that we do have a judicial system that has its warts, but it is a system that is free and independent. We do not elect judges like the Reform Party would likely do if it was given the opportunity, or as they do in the United States where Boss Hog rules the day. We do not subject the public to making decisions like that.\n\nMembers of our judiciary are appointed through a system. They are educated. They learn the system. By and large, the Supreme Court of Canada is one of the most outstanding institutions in the world.\n\nFrom time to time there will be provincial supreme courts and others that will issue decisions with which we will disagree. Child pornography is one, and we, the government, are at the supreme court fighting that decision. I want to hear what the members say if the supreme court rules against the court decision in B.C.\n\nThis is homophobia. This is nonsense. The bill should be passed to provide fairness and equity for all Canadians.",

            "text": "Mr. Speaker, I am pleased today to speak to Bill C-23, an act to modernize the Statutes of Canada in relation to benefits and obligations.\n\nThis morning, the member for Hochelaga—Maisonneuve participated very intensively in the debate, giving it more than his all. We know how involved our colleague is with respect to the recognition of same sex spouses, and I believe that the member for Hochelaga—Maisonneuve has succeeded not only in stating the Bloc Quebecois position on this issue, but also very certainly in influencing the positions of certain other parties in the House.\n\nThis 166 page document, which I recently examined, is an important bill, as all omnibus bills are, let there be no mistake.\n\nIt is a bill that has a major impact, because it amends 68 federal statutes to include same sex spouse in the definition of common law partner.\n\nThe importance of this bill becomes evident when we look at the number of ministers sponsoring it. I looked into this and identified five such ministers, from the Department of Human Resources Development, to the Department of Finance, Treasury Board's human resources directorate, the Department of Justice and the Department of Citizenship and Immigration.\n\nThese are major changes involving over 20 departments and agencies. Basically, this bill has one purpose: to restore equity. This equity will make it possible to modernize certain regimes by introducing equality in the law for common law couples but also for same sex or opposite sex couples, in accordance with a May 1999 supreme court decision.\n\nI will take a few moments to review this important decision pronounced on May 22, 1999. This lengthy decision boils down to this: A couple is a couple, regardless of sexual orientation.\n\nIn addition, it strikes down a section of the Ontario Family Law Act which makes a distinction between heterosexual couples and homosexual couples with respect to the entitlement to maintenance upon the break-up of a union, whether it be a marriage or a common law relationship.\n\nThe immediate consequence of this judgment was that it rendered that section of the act inoperative in Ontario. In fact, this supreme court decision marked the end of the legal debate. From that moment on a new debate ensued, one which became political, parliamentary, and inevitably involved the day to day administration of the government.\n\nThe government therefore had no choice but to come up with Bill C-23 in order to comply with the May 22, 1999 decision.\n\nI will give a chronology of the events of the various changes that have occurred, as well as of the facts. It is important to point out that, as far back as 1977, the Government of Quebec was the first to ban discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.\n\nAs far back as 1979, the Canadian Human Rights Commission recommended that the Canadian Human Rights Act be amended to include sexual orientation. This recommendation is contained in each of the commission's annual reports, up to and including 1995.\n\nAnother date that must be recalled is 1982, when the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms was incorporated into the Canadian constitution.\n\nIn 1985, section 15 of the charter came into effect, the section on the right to equality. The report by the parliamentary Sub-committee on Equality Rights, “Equality for All”, called for the banning of all discrimination based on sexual orientation by the Canadian Human Rights Act.\n\nIn 1992, the Ontario appeal court found that the Canadian Human Rights Act needed to be interpreted as forbidding discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. As well, during the same year the Canadian Forces announced that they were terminating the restrictions on enlistment and promotion on grounds of sexual orientation.\n\nBills S-15 and C-108, whose aim was to add sexual orientation to the Canadian Human Rights Act, were introduced in the Senate and the House of Commons respectively. They both died on the order paper in September 1993.\n\nIn 1993, the Supreme Court of Canada rejected the allegation that “family situation” included same sex couples. In 1994, the Government of Ontario introduced Bill 167, which was intended to expand the definition of conjugal relations in Ontario legislation to include homosexual couples. It was rejected at second reading by a vote of 68 to 59.\n\nIn 1995, the Supreme Court of Canada gave its first decision under the terms of section 15 of the charter on sexual orientation and the awarding of benefits to same sex spouses. The nine members of the court decided that sexual orientation is an analogous ground for the purposes of section 15, and a majority of the justices decided that the definition of spouse in the Old Age Security Act as a person of the opposite sex contravened section 15. However, a majority felt that the contravention was justified under section 1 of the charter.\n\nI will also point out, as I mentioned in the first part of my remarks, that on May 20, 1999, in an eight to one decision, the Supreme Court of Canada stated that the definition of spouse as in part III of the Ontario Family Law Act, which prevented same sex partners from seeking support at the breakup of a relationship, contravened section 15 of the charter and was unjustified under section 1. The court ordered this provision repealed, but suspended reparations for six months to enable the legislators in Ontario to correct the contravention of the charter.",

            "text": "Mr. Speaker, I had not indicated when I began that I would be sharing my time, because I intended to use my full allotted time, that is, 20 minutes.\n\nOn May 25, the House of Commons passed Bill C-78. This important pension reform bill included amendments to replace the provisions authorizing the payment of survivor benefits to unmarried opposite sex spouses with provisions authorizing the payment of benefits to spouses without distinction as to sex. Bill C-78 is the first federal statute to explicitly provide for benefits to same sex spouses.\n\nOn June 10, Quebec's national assembly unanimously passed a bill to amend various legislative provisions concerning common law couples. This omnibus bill amended the definition of common law spouse in 28 statutes and 11 regulations so as to include homosexual couples, giving them the same status, rights and obligations as unmarried heterosexual couples.\n\nThe amended legislation has to do primarily with compensation for accidents in the workplace, health and security in the workplace, labour standards, pension benefits, public sector pension plans and social assistance.\n\nIn October, Ontario passed an omnibus bill amending 67 statutes to bring them into line with the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada.\n\nClearly, the government had to follow suit. Unfortunately, the government has once again waited for certain decisions of the courts, including, of course, the supreme court, before introducing this omnibus bill, which will amend a certain number of statutes.\n\nIt is also important to point out that the proposed amendments do not all go one way. In effect, they offer new benefits to same sex couples, but they also impose new obligations.\n\nThe proposed legislative amendments will preserve the fundamental importance of marriage in our society, in that the definition of marriage will remain unchanged. I mention this to reassure those Liberal members or members of the opposition who are rather conservative, and we know a number of them.\n\nThe fact that members of homosexual couples have been denied spousal allowances has generated criticism, as we are well aware, but this criticism was often basically a matter of principle. Gay rights advocates argue that homosexual couples who pay taxes are unfairly denied social benefits and do not receive anything in return for their direct contribution to certain plans, and that they in fact fund the plans of heterosexual couples.\n\nOthers contend that the state should continue to not recognize homosexual couples, because granting rights to these couples threatens family values. Also, some gay and lesbian couples refuse to accept the legal obligations and benefits that result from this situation.\n\nThe public also expressed its opinion on the issue on a number of occasions. Several public opinion polls were conducted and the results were released. I should point out that the Angus Reid poll conducted for the Department of Justice in the fall of 1998 clearly shows that this bill reflects the will of Canadians.\n\nIndeed, according to that poll, 74% of the respondents agreed with granting federal benefits to gay couples, while 67% felt that same sex couples should get the same benefits and face the same obligations as common law couples. Moreover, 84% of the respondents felt that gays and lesbians should be protected from discrimination. Finally, 59% were of the opinion that homosexual couples should be included in the definition of spouse.\n\nAs members can see, we have a number of elements, but several arguments show that Canada is lagging behind on this issue. If we consider, among other things, the omnibus bill introduced by the Quebec government, the ruling issued by the supreme court on May 22, and the action taken by the Ontario government on this issue, it is clear that the changes proposed in Bill C-23, which, as I said before, will impact on 68 federal acts, are necessary.\n\nI will be very pleased to support this bill.\n\nA motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 deemed to have been moved.",

            "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise this evening to talk about the World Trade Organization, agriculture and the plight of our farmers.\n\nThe World Trade Organization talks broke down in Seattle last year and it is a good thing they did. This hiatus gives us some time to reflect upon the Liberal government's blind pursuit of a trade agenda that has been destructive to our farmers. They are hostages of the government's cult-like adherence to the ideology of free trade at any cost.\n\nIt is true the government's friends at the Business Council on National Issues repeat the mantra with zeal “free trade, free trade, free trade” and our so-called national newspapers sing the same hymn “globalize, globalize, globalize”. Our trade minister, our agriculture minister, our Prime Minister are all choirboys in the same chorus.\n\nPeople in my part of the country are asking interesting questions. They are saying that if this free trade is such a wonderful thing, then why are we, the grain farmers, in such dire straits today?\n\nAgriculture exports have increased by 65% over the past five years and farm receipts have increased by more than 43% over the last 10 years. Why is it in these circumstances that farmers' net income has actually dropped by 11%? Why are the very people whose hard work provides the statistics the government uses to promote its trade agenda losing their farms?\n\nDuring the Christmas break I visited some of the farm communities in my riding. I was told that one small community had lost four families since last fall and the prediction was that it would lose at least that many again before spring seeding. I have spoken with farmers, with their family members, with regional municipality councillors and reeves. Believe me, there is a very crucial need for some support and reinvestment in rural Canada, especially in western Canada.\n\nIt is time for the government to come out of its trance and to realize that farmers in western Canada are paying the price for a warped trade agenda. They are paying with their farms, with the break-up of their families and some tragically with their lives as they are unable to bear the stress any longer.\n\nCanadian farmers, in particular those who grow grains, are facing the worst situation since the Great Depression. The government's own income statistics and forecasts tell us that the next five years will not be any easier for the thousands of families that put bread on our tables. For farmers in my province of Saskatchewan the news is grim. Incomes for 2001, 2002 and 2003 will be below zero in the negative range.\n\nIf the Seattle talks had gone as the faceless WTO bureaucrats had wanted, our farmers would have been even more vulnerable to the cold winds of international trade. Since 1993 our federal government has cut its support for grain farmers by 60% all in the name of liberalized trade.\n\nMy colleagues in the New Democratic Party and I have been calling for the government to set aside $1 billion from the $100 billion forecast surplus for the next five years, a mere 1% of that, to pay for some support to farm families who need it terribly badly.\n\nCanadian farmers represent a mere 3% of our population. Through their hard work they support about 14% of our jobs and one-quarter of our trade surplus, but they are asking why they do not benefit from it. We are saying that it is the government's responsibility to see that they do benefit from it rather than being left to twist in the wind.",

We congratulate him on his byelection win in Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar.\n\nI will deal with the points he has raised and the general and severe challenges being faced by the farm sector.\n\nThe Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada and the government clearly recognize the very serious nature of the financial situation many Canadian farmers are currently facing. Our government is taking the broadest possible approach to this situation.\n\nThe WTO agriculture negotiations are an important opportunity to seek greater disciplines in the use of production and trade distorting subsidies. Canada's initial position in these trade negotiations, which was developed through two years of extensive consultations with Canadians, makes it clear that we will seek the complete elimination of agricultural export subsidies and maximum reductions in production and trade distorting domestic support programs, including an overall limit of all sorts and all types of domestic support programs.\n\nThe close co-operation between the government and the Canadian agriculture and agri-food industry that characterizes the development of Canada's initial agriculture negotiating position was also fully present at the Seattle WTO ministerial conference held at the beginning of December 1999. The continuation of this team Canada approach as the negotiations progress will ensure that Canada will achieve the very best results possible for farmers right across Canada. While I recognize that the negotiations will take time and they likely cannot make the situation better in the next year or two, they are the only way to solve the problem of subsidies distorting agricultural markets once and for all.\n\nIn response to an industry request on January 13 of this year, the Government of Canada made a new commitment of up to $1 billion for the next two years to design a new disaster program to assist those producers most in need. Also a new spring advance payment program will provide assistance quickly before spring crops are planted. Individual farmers will be able to access up to $20,000 in interest free loans to help get their crops in the ground. Applications should be available in the coming weeks.",
